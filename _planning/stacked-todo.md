# Before Class

* Create timesheet / spreadsheet / form for clocking in, clocking out
    * Absolute Minimum: Class + ~6 hours
    * Absolute Maximum: Class + ~10 hours
    * Make clear: this is a guide, not an evaluation metric.

* Create a single site for both

* Use contracts / SCALE-UP participation rubric
    * Revise contracts every 2 weeks / at team roll points / something
    * (Ultimately expect contracts to become stable and just be ratified)

    * Similar but different for each course
    * Matt: Using BA4ABW + Associate, rotate roles every 2 weeks
    * Jan: Doing something

* Evening meeting time for AAAD. Weekly? Process leads only?
    * Fix a time, even if I don't meet with them every time.
    
* Chad's role?
    * Process leads meet with Chad once per week
    * Evening meeting, most likely---can be whenever. (We will fix a time, but if they want to do it at some other time, that's fine.)
    * Chad meets with us individually or otherwise once per week.
    * Read/comment on documentation/software in progress

* indiv: meet with Chad
