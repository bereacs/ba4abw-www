## Before Classes Start

* Panic oodles!

* Jan: Read Scale-up on assessment
* Matt: Peer Feedback Form (Moodle Quiz)

* Both: Syllabus
    * Jan: Technology Policies, Atmosphere
		
* Jan: Poke stacked students about syllabus (or, provide a template/suggestion.)

* Both: Look again at Tuesday/Thursday homework.

* WHat happens when peer evals don't happen on time. (Zero the person who is late.) Process lead should be making sure everyone does this. (Can't 5% bonus if all team evals are not in on time.)

## Mon, Jan 7

* Fix the room.

## Thu, Jan 10

## Low priority

* How can we project tablets to everyone? 

* Both: How do they capture images/sounds outside of class during the first week? Check out cameras? (Audacity documentation?)

* Both: Do students check out tablets for their pair? Do we allow them to remove the devices? (If lost/stolen $250, etc.)
