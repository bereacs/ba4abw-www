## Before Classes Start

* Panic oodles!

* Jan: Peer Feedback Form --Google docs

* Both: Final? <GRIN> syllabus review
		
* Jan: Poke stacked students about syllabus (or, provide a template/suggestion.)

* Both: Look again at Tuesday/Thursday homework.

* Matt; Write this up IN SYLLABUS?  WHat happens when peer evals don't happen on time. (Zero the person who is late.) Process lead should be making sure everyone does this. (Can't 5% bonus if all team evals are not in on time.)

## Mon, Jan 7

* Both: Get document projector.

* Fix the room.

## Thu, Jan 10

* Jan: Pick up tablets and have TAs set-up
* Assign roles and teams for first group
* Avacado Tart, Brownie, Cupcake, Donut, Eclair, Froyo, Gingerbread, Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwich, Jellybean, Kettle Corn, Licorice
* Matt: What is involved in collecting data in Google Spreadsheet and moving it around? How do we collect initial survey data? What is it for?
* Matt: Write John/Kevin about server

## Low priority

* How can we project tablets to everyone? 

* Both: How do they capture images/sounds outside of class during the first week? Check out cameras? (Audacity documentation?)

* Both: Do students check out tablets for their pair? Do we allow them to remove the devices? (If lost/stolen $250, etc.)
