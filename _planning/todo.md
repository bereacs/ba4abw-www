* Panic more!

* Both: Syllabus
    * Jan: Technology Policies, Atmosphere
	
* Both: Remove "I" words.

* Both: Get document projector.
	
* Matt: See google doc with other things. (Move them here.)

* Matt: What is involved in collecting data in Google Spreadsheet and moving it around? How do we collect initial survey data? What is it for?

* Jan: Read Scale-up on assessment

* Jan: Poke stacked students about syllabus (or, provide a template/suggestion.)

* Jan: Pick up tablets and have TAs set-up

* Both: Look again at Tuesday/Thursday homework.

## Low priority

* How can we project tablets to everyone? 

* Both: How do they capture images/sounds outside of class during the first week? Check out cameras? (Audacity documentation?)

* Both: Do students check out tablets for their pair? Do we allow them to remove the devices? (If lost/stolen $250, etc.)
