## Two reasonable solutions to Windows to Android driver problem

Unlike on Mac and Linux, there is a driver problem in using App Inventor via Windows.  You might think hope that the Google Nexus 7 would just work with the drivers packaged with any recent download of App Inventor.  Unfortunately, youÂ’d be disappointed.  The problem is well documented, but the best solution is not so well documented.


The solution which I recommend is to install [PDANet] (http://pdanet.co/bin/PdaNetZ350.exe), which is a popular tethering software.  I recommend this over other choices because of the variety in hardware we are likely to encounter in student laptops as well as with students possibly wanting to install apps on their own android phones.  Before installing PDANet App inventor would not live demo on any of the three Android devices I have access to (my phone, my Transformer, and your Nexus7) from either my laptop or from the loaner.  After the install, it worked perfectly from both laptops on all three devices.  The only issue is that PDANet will need to be installed during class because it requires the Android be connected during the install.  I was intentional about doing the install with different devices, and it did not matter. Yey!


An alternative solution is to install specific divers for each device rather than generic Android drivers.  That solution has caused people with multiple devices to see conflicts. Hence my recommendation.
