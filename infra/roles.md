## Team Roles

Teams of four are made up of the Process Lead, the Advocate, the Documentation Lead, and the Entrepreneur.

* Process Lead (Driver P/A) 
* Advocate (Navigator P/A)

### Process Lead sounds like:

* "Does anyone have an idea what approach we could take for this App?"
* "We have to move on. If we have time, we'll come back to this discussion later."
* "That's an interesting idea. Does anyone else have a suggestion before we evaluate it?"
* "We need to wrap up this prototype in order to have enough time to discuss the prompts."

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Advocate: 

* Makes sure all likely user experiences are explored
* Suggests alternative approaches or concerns with suggested designs
* Suggests alternate methods or interpretations
* Questions designs and understanding
* Ensures all facets of possible user questions and misconceptions are explored

### Advocate sounds like:

* "Can we visualize this problem differently?"
* "Does anyone want me to explain what's helpful about this layout?"
* "It feels like we're spinning our wheels. Let's take another look at this previous decision."
* "Should the App act like that? How do we expect it to act? Why is it acting differently than we want?"
* "Are we accounting for all user experience factors?"

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Documentation Lead:

* Records thinking and team process
* Checks for understanding of all team members
* Makes sure all team members agree on documentation
* Monitors and records decisions
* Ensures that all team members agree with phrasing
* Verifies that all team members understand and agree
* Submits reports for the team
	
### Documentation Lead sounds like:

* "Do we agree that this prototype is what we want?"
* "Before we go on, do we all understand and agree with what is written so far?"
* "I'm hearing more than one idea. I'm not sure what to write. Can we agree on how to proceed?"
* "Does everyone agree with this?"
* "Does everyone understand this concept and how it is used?"
* "Does everyone agree with this report?"

* Summarizes the team's vision and the team's discussion of how to realize the vision.
* Maintains team's energy while working through encouragement, humor, enthusiasm, etc.
* Summarizes the planning and results.
* Works with the team to develop an "elevator speach" to pitch the design/ purpose, etc.

### Entrepreneur sounds like:

* "So, we started with the campus layout, and proceeded to..."
* "You have a very insightful idea."
* "We are doing well; we have an App which is goign to go viral!"
* "I see that we are on the right track. Good job everyone!"
* "This App is going to make the world a better place because..."

-------------------------

### Driver: 

* Works at the keyboard to create the App Inventor code
* Leads sequence of steps following the coding plan
* Keeps the pair focused
* Ensures full participation by navigator
* Makes sure the navigator agrees with the App Inventor code as it is created.
* Submits the program for the pair

### Driver sounds like:

* "Do you agree with this structure?"
* "I think this is how we get what we planned, do you agree?"
* "How can I create this functionality in the code?"
* "Does it make sense to include this in this block?"

### Navigator:

* Helps to actively debug the program while program creation is occurring
* Thinks of alternative ways to express the App Inventor code
* Summarizes the pair's discussion and conclusions
* Helps by managing time
* When pair's motivation is low, uses humor, enthusiasm, or suggest a new idea to energize the pair

### Navigator sounds like:

* "Shouldn't that be a different block?"
* "What about expressing the App Inventor code in this other way?"
* "We are running out of class time, when can we get together again?"
* "Ha, that ran exactly like we wanted!"
* "I think we could improve the functionality, if we..."
* "So, here's what we've decided on the layout of the code…"
