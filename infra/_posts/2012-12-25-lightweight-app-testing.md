## Testing Apps

What makes an app "good?" Swishy graphics? Cool sound effects? Do sound effects matter if the app crashes constantly? Do pretty graphics matter if it is hard to use?

Pretty book covers sell trade paperbacks; a solid, leather-bound volume lasts for decades. 

### Background Questions

As you approach a new application, ask yourself (and answer) some questions:

1. What is the primary function of this application? <br/>
  Is it a game? A utility?

1. Who is the intended user of this application? <br/>
   A casual gamer? A busy administrator? A student? 

1. Are there any applications similar to this one? <br/>
   "Angry Animals," "Angry Alien," and "Stupid Zombies" are all clones of "Angry Birds." It isn't enough to say "yes, they're both games."

### Exploring the App

1. What is the 

who the targeted user is (Site administrator, power-user teacher, standard teacher, student, etc.)
what end-user testing has the developer already undertaken, if any (and what was learned from this)
what level of instruction or training is anticipated to use the feature, or whether the developer feels the feature's use is self-evident and intuitive
what other interface is this feature similar to or was inspired by (either within Moodle or with another application)
whether all features are included in the current form for the next anticipated release of the feature
