## Testing Apps

What makes an app "good?" Swishy graphics? Cool sound effects? Do sound effects matter if the app crashes constantly? Do pretty graphics matter if it is hard to use?

Pretty book covers sell trade paperbacks; a solid, leather-bound volume lasts for decades. 

### Background Questions

As you approach a new application, ask yourself (and answer) some questions:

1. **What is the primary function of this application?** <br/>
  Is it a game? A utility?

1. **Who is the intended user of this application?** <br/>
   A casual gamer? A busy administrator? A student? 

1. **Are there any applications similar to this one?** <br/>
   "Angry Animals," "Angry Alien," and "Stupid Zombies" are all clones of "Angry Birds." It isn't enough to say "yes, they're both games."

### Privacy Concerns
  
1. **Are you required to have an account on (insert service here)?** <br/>
Are you *required* to log into Facebook, Google, or some other service (thus surrendering your privacy) before you're allowed to use the app?

1. **Is it a "freemium" app?** <br/>
Is the expectation that you'll use one or two features, and then pay more to use the "whole" app?

1. **What, when installed, does it expect access to?**<br/>
Does it require access to more than the network? Can it read your address book? What else?

### Obviousness

1. **Is it obvious how to start using the app?** <br/>
  Does the game have a "Play" button? Is it a utility? How do you get data into it?

1. **Is it easy to save your work?**<br/>
If so, where did it go?

1. **Is it obvious how to delete your data and/or opt out of sharing features?** <br/>
If you don't want to share your location, is that easy to opt out of? (As an example.)

1. **Was this app obviously inspired by some other (common) application?**

1. **Are there (obviously) missing features?**<br/>
If you think so, what are they, and why?

### Conclusion

For each app that you survey, capture your thoughts on each of these categories (background, privacy, obviousness), and any additional conclusion/summary thoughts you feel are appropriate.

Finally, what questions do you think are missing from this "lightweight app testing" protocol?
