## Team Roles

Teams of four are made up of the Process Lead, the Advocate, the Documentation Lead, and the Entrepreneur.

Jump To:

* [Process Lead](#process-lead)
* [Advocate](#advocate)
* [Documentation Lead](#documentation-lead)
* [Entrepreneur](#entrepreneur)
* [Pair Programming](#pair-programming)

---------------------------------

### Process Lead

* Facilitates the team discussion and team decision making process
* Manages time and keeps team on task
* Ensures that each team member participates
* Reinforces the merits of everyone's ideas
* Supports participation from all team members.
	
#### Things a Process Lead might say

* "Does anyone have an idea what approach we could take for this App?"
* "We have to move on. If we have time, we'll come back to this discussion later."
* "That's an interesting idea. Does anyone else have a suggestion before we evaluate it?"
* "We need to wrap up this prototype in order to have enough time to discuss the prompts."

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Advocate 

* Makes sure all likely user experiences are explored
* Suggests alternative approaches or concerns with suggested designs
* Suggests alternate methods or interpretations
* Questions designs and understanding
* Ensures all facets of possible user questions and misconceptions are explored

### Things an Advocate might say

* "Can we visualize this problem differently?"
* "Does anyone want me to explain what's helpful about this layout?"
* "It feels like we're spinning our wheels. Let's take another look at this previous decision."
* "Should the App act like that? How do we expect it to act? Why is it acting differently than we want?"
* "Are we accounting for all user experience factors?"

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Documentation Lead

* Records thinking and team process
* Checks for understanding of all team members
* Makes sure all team members agree on documentation
* Monitors and records decisions
* Ensures that all team members agree with phrasing
* Verifies that all team members understand and agree
* Submits reports for the team
	
### Things a Documentation Lead might say

* "Do we agree that this prototype is what we want?"
* "Before we go on, do we all understand and agree with what is written so far?"
* "I'm hearing more than one idea. I'm not sure what to write. Can we agree on how to proceed?"
* "Does everyone agree with this?"
* "Does everyone understand this concept and how it is used?"
* "Does everyone agree with this report?"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Entrepreneur

* Summarizes the team's vision and the team's discussion of how to realize the vision.
* Maintains team's energy while working through encouragement, humor, enthusiasm, etc.
* Summarizes the planning and results.
* Works with the team to develop an "elevator speach" to pitch the design/ purpose, etc.

### Things an Entrepreneur might say

* "So, we started with the campus layout, and proceeded to..."
* "You have a very insightful idea."
* "We are doing well; we have an App which is goign to go viral!"
* "I see that we are on the right track. Good job everyone!"
* "This App is going to make the world a better place because..."

-------------------------

### Pair Programming

While we work in groups of four, it really works best if we write code in groups of two. One of you will become the **Driver** (who sits at the keyboard) and the **Navigator** (who keeps the Driver honest).

#### The Team Breakdown

You should end up playing both roles at multiple points throughout the semester.

##### Green Team

* Process Lead {{site.arrow-right}} Driver 
* Advocate  {{site.arrow-right}} Navigator

##### Purple Team

* Documentation Lead  {{site.arrow-right}} Driver
* Entrepreneur  {{site.arrow-right}} Navigator

#### The Driver

As the Driver, you take the lead on the writing of the code. This does not mean you take the lead on *planning* the code, or that you do all of the work. It just means you're at the keyboard.

* Works at the keyboard to create the App Inventor code
* Leads sequence of steps following the coding plan
* Keeps the pair focused
* Ensures full participation by navigator
* Makes sure the navigator agrees with the App Inventor code as it is created.
* Submits the program for the pair

##### Things a Driver might say

* "Do you agree with this structure?"
* "I think this is how we get what we planned, do you agree?"
* "How can I create this functionality in the code?"
* "Does it make sense to include this in this block?"

-------------------------

#### Navigator

As the Navigator, it is your job to keep your mind on the design. The Driver will invariably get confused at some point by all the buttons and things on the screen; when that happens, you help them figure out their problems and get them back on track to solving the actual problem you're trying to tackle.

* Helps to actively debug the program while program creation is occurring
* Thinks of alternative ways to express the App Inventor code
* Summarizes the pair's discussion and conclusions
* Helps by managing time
* When pair's motivation is low, uses humor, enthusiasm, or suggest a new idea to energize the pair

##### Things a Navigator might say

* "Shouldn't that be a different block?"
* "What about expressing the App Inventor code in this other way?"
* "We are running out of class time, when can we get together again?"
* "Ha, that ran exactly like we wanted!"
* "I think we could improve the functionality, if we..."
* "So, here's what we've decided on the layout of the codeâ€¦"
