## How to Submit your App

Typically, there will be two major deliverables we will want you to submit.  

---------------------------------

### A zip file, containing editable App inventor code and needed media files

One creates the zip file from the main App Inventor page where you see your list of projects. [http://http://beta.appinventor.mit.edu](http://http://beta.appinventor.mit.edu)

First, check the box next to the project you want to submit.  Then under "More Actions," choose "download source."

### The apk, which is a package your phone or tablet can run

One creates the apk from inside the design area of your project.  

Open the project.  Then if you look in the upper right hand corner, you will see "package for phone."  Choose "download to this computer."
