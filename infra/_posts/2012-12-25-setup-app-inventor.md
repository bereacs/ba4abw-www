## Get/Login to a Google/gmail account

To use App Inventor, you need to have a Google or a gmail account.  If you do not already have one, go to [https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?service=mail](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?service=mail) and sign up.

## Test your Java configuration

1. App Inventor runs in a browser.  We recommend Mozilla Firefox 3.6 (or higher) or Google Chrome 4.0 (or higher).  Open one of these browsers.
1. Your computer needs to run an up to date version of Java. Test your Java configuration by performing THREE tests:
    * First, visit the Java test page at [http://www.java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml](http://www.java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml) 
    * You should see a message like the following that Java is working and that the version is up to date:
    
    <img src="{{site.base}}/images/java-is-working.png" />
    
    * Is this still indented?
