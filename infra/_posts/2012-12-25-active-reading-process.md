Reading is not a passive act: if you want to learn from what you read, you need to approach it systematically. That is another way of saying that there is a process to reading when your **goal is to retain, reflect, and understand**.

In *Active Reading Skills* by Kathleen McWhorter, she identifies the key characteristics of **active** and **passive** readers:

I don't know which you are, but I know which you should aspire to be. What follows is the process we will employ in all of our reading assignments, and it is intended to help you practice becoming an efficient and effective active reader.

## The {{site.short}} Active Reading Process

#### Review the Purpose

First, review why you're doing this reading. Write down a list of two or three things you expect to get from the reading.

#### First Pass: The Preview

In the first pass through the text, you should do the following:

1. **Read the title of the text/chapter/section**. Reflect on what that title might mean for what is about to come.

1. **Creep on the author**. Who is this person? Why do they matter? Do they have a Facebook page?

1. **Read the first paragraph**. A good author will give you a sense for where the entire chapter/section is headed in the first paragraph. Read it completely.

1. **Skim the sections**. Read through all of the headings, and the first sentence under each heading. At this point, your suspicions about where the reading is headed should be confirmed (or challenged). 

1. **Read the first sentence of every paragraph**. Go back to the start of the text, and now read through the first sentence of every paragraph. In the previous step, you only read the first sentence of each *section*; now, read the first sentence of every *paragraph*.

1. **Read the last paragraph**.

1. **Write a summary**. Now, write a summary. This is three or four sentences that summarize the major points of the reading. It could also be a bulleted list, but you should practice formulating your thoughts in coherent paragraphs and sentences.

At this point, you should have a pretty clear understanding of what the reading is about. Now, it's time to hang some details on the reading.

#### Second Pass: The Critical Read

In the second pass, you need to do a critical read of the text. In this pass, you go through with a highlighter and pen to really dig into the text. Now that you know what the text is about, **you're ready to learn from it**.

* **Highlight and underline** important points or things that you think are critical to the author's argument.

* **Record your thoughts in the margin** as you are reading. These might summarize ideas succinctly, or they might reflect ideas that the reading inspired for you.

* **Look for evidence**. Are you reading something that makes unsupported claims, or does the author actually provide clear arguments and evidence that stand up to scrutiny?

* **Ask questions**. In the margin (or at the end of sections/chapters) you might be left with questions. Write them down. They're often good starting points for further research and learning.

#### Reflect and Rhuminate

In {{site.short}}, we will often ask you to reflect and write about what you've read. After two passes through the reading, you should be ready to reflect meaningfully on what you've read. To do that, we've provided you with the Active Reading Support Environment.

### The Active Reading Support Environment

It might be a pain, but we've provided you with a Word document that helps you implement this process. We call it the *Active Reading Support Environment*.

<div align="center">
	<a href="{{site.arse.url}}">The Active Reading Support Envirionment {{support.arse.version}}</a> {{site.word}}
</div>

For just about every reading assignment, we're going to ask you to download this document and use it to structure your reading responses. **You will come to know it well**.

Happy reading!
