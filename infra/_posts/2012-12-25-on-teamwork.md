##  Team Contracts

Research indicates that the following five aspects are critical for success in teamwork: Positive interdependence, individual accountability, face-to-face interactions, and regular self-assessment of team functioning.  We hope that you gain benefit from working with others and work to improve your skills in communication, decision-making, leadership, as well as conflict-management. 

To distribute the workload evenly, and to ensure that each team member gets the full range of team experience, roles are assigned to each member of the team.  And we ask teams to develop team contracts.  Here are some draft contracts you can use to start from:
