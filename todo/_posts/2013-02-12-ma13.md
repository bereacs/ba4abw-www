### Task

Read chapter 5 (Ladybug!), and chapter 17 *Creating Animated Apps*. You can find this in Moodle in the folder **App\_Inventor\_Chapters** under Resources.

Before reading, it may help to watch [this video on 2D computer animation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJr87-ngSrc). Although it is a step or two beyond where you are right now, it is 4:20 long, and does a nice job of illustrating some fundamental concepts of animation in a short period of time.

### Objectives

1. Prepare for our next programming challenge by reading through the tutorial.
1. Think about how animation works.

You are encouraged to develop the Ladybug! app as you go, but are not submitting it as part of this reflection. Actively programming as you read will help you understand some things, and develop questions for others.

### How to Read in {{site.short}}

Before you dive into the assignment, please first read about the [{{site.short}} Active Reading Support Environment]({{site.base}}/infra/active-reading-process/). We ask you to apply that process to this reading.

Why? It makes it easier for us to evaluate your progress, and gives you a place to ask questions that we can respond to.

### Reflection and Rumination

Your answers should, typically, be a paragraph or two in length. Single-sentence answers are unlikely to be thorough or complete enough to receive full credit.

1. Describe the role of timers in the process of animation. Use an example that you could imagine exploring on the tablet.

1. Consider the image below. A cat is being animated in on the line shown, with a heading of 165. We want it to bounce off of the right-hand wall. Describe how you would calculate its new heading.

1. Consider the second set of images; it is the same cat, but now we use the variable, *heading*, to represent the direction it is marching along. (The reason for a variable is that it might change from time to time.) Now, using that variable, can you write an expression that describes how to calculate the new heading when it hits the right-hand wall? Seek the help of colleagues, TAs, or your professors if you aren't sure where to start.

1. What is your single favorite example of animation today? What set it apart in your mind from all other examples of the genre?
