### Task

* Review the design-related readings and activities.
* Review programming-related activities.

### Objectives

1. Review the patterns of logic and reasoning expressed in code that we have seen so far (variables, OnClick handlers, etc.).
1. Review user-centered design process.
1. Reflect on your team process and experiences to date.

In class on Tuesday, we will present some of our Mole Mash Twist games, and then spend the rest of our time reviewing material as a group. If your review is effective, you will (in essence) **write your own exam**. This is a Good Thing, because it means that you will be very well prepared for the first exam.

The goal of this assignment is to help you organize your thoughts regarding the work and reading we've done so far, so that you will be better prepared, and do better, on the exam.

### Review Process

We recommend the following process. You are welcome to discuss and collaborate with your teammates on preparation, but you are responsible for submitting your own, unique questions in each instance.

#### Programming Related

We read chapters 1-3 of the Apps book, as well as chapter 16 related to variables. In each of the first three chapters, we wrote a program. 

For each chapter, identify 2-3 themes (or more) that were critical in that chapter. You might also identify the programming constructs---the "blocks" in App Inventor---that you were introduced to. For example, in "Hello Purr" (which became "My My Berea"), you learned how to use an OnClick block to handle button presses.

Then, for each theme, try and generate 3-5 true/false and multiple choice questions about that subject. 

Again, put these themes and questions into the Word/Google document you are developing. 

#### Design Related

For each chapter in Krug, identify 2, possibly 3 key points that you think were critical in that chapter. You're trying to identify **themes**.

Then, for each of these themes, come up with 3-5 true/false or multiple choice questions that you think get at the content in the chapter. 

Put your themes and questions in a Word/Google document so you can upload it into Moodle.

#### Projects

Finally, you might think about the team projects: [My My Berea]({{site.todo}}/tp0) and [Mole Mash with a Twist]({{site.todo}}/jtp1/). What critical themes or ideas did these projects exemplify, and what tasks did we ask of you?

Generate 2-3 themes that you think arose from these projects, and generate several T/F and multiple choice questions about these themes. 

### Submission

Submit your Word/Google document to Moodle before class. We will share the questions you generate with everyone, including some that we will develop together in class, so that you will all have access to a comprehensive study guide.
