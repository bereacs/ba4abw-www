This activity will be carried out **in class** on {% duein 0 %}.

## Objectives

1. Practice running lightweight paper prototyping tests.
1. Explore multiple ideas for a tour guide application.

## Task

On {% duein 0 %} we will come together with our prototypes and run some "mock tests" within our team. These shouldn't take long, as you all know what a paper prototyping session looks like. (It should sound a lot like Krug's testing methods, but on paper.) 

After you each have tested your prototypes, discuss them, and identify what elements of each that you think are interesting. 

## Improved Mockups

Once you've tested each-other's prototypes, develop a refined, high-quality prototype that you think captures your final tour design. Our goal is to have four tour designs coming from each group, each ready for further discussion and testing.

We will use this design as the basis for our next programming project. 

## Submission

There is no particular submission for this exercise, but you should not get rid of your prototypes; we'll need them later.
