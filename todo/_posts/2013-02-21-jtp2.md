## Objective

1. Improve an existing "coin-flipping" app by adding an animation
1. Gain practive in reading and improve existing code

This is a project to be completed as a team, and there are parts of this project for each team member acting in their assigned role.

**We provide hints throughout to help you in your specific roles; read!**

**It is time to rotate your rolls within your team.  Please rotate to a new role for this project.**

## Coin Fipping App

Matt wanted a coin flipping app, so he downloaded some code from [Trinity College](http://www.cs.trincoll.edu/~ram/cpsc110/tutorials/faircoin/hw-faircoin.html).  He made a few changes, but it is still unbelievably boring!!! 

We need you to help Matt, by improving this code. For example, it really needs an animation.  As another example, wouldn't be better to be able to shake the phone to flip the coin instead of pushing the button?  or maybe both?  Can you think of other improvements?

Download the source code from: 
FIXME:Add internal link here! (I put the zip file in media.) FIXME

## Brainstorming

**Your team should first brainstorm a list of animations and improvments you wish to make and then select two of these to implement**. 

## Select Designs

Based on the ideas generated during brainstorming, select the most promising two ideas.

### Filtering 

We would like your apps to:
* Use the Clock
* Have Multiple Moving ImageSprite components and/or can be manipulated by the user
* Handle collisions
* Have Procedures to implement repeated behaviors (i.e. looping)
* Have Randomness
* Use Vibration

One way to filter your ideas (or, to explore them further) is to think in terms of the things you know how to do.

### Filtering Based on Time

This is where the Process Lead plays a role. Once the pairs in your team have found projects they want to do, you should be asking your team "Can we do this in a week?" While your programmers may be excited to explore something cool, you need to ask the hard questions, and keep people from trying to take on too much in too little time.

Remember that each of you will ultimately be expected to create your game in App Inventor, so make sure that you select two games you believe you can implement.

## The Report

Along with your applications, your team needs to submit a short report. It should have the following structure:

### Identification

The first part of every team report MUST be:

* Your team's name
* The name of every team member, and their role
* The date the report was submitted

Every report should have a clear title that connects it to the project you are submitting.

### Introduction

The report should begin with a short introduction that makes clear to the reader the task your team undertook and the thematic approach the group took in its game development.

### Game Descriptions

There should be a brief description of each game (3-4 paragraphs). 

Include a screen shot of each game while running. There are two ways you could do this:

1. Take a screenshot while it is running in Bluestacks. You did this in the previous assignment. (**TUTORIAL**: You can use the [Windows 7 snipping tool to do this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmR7k65gtM4).)

1. Take a screenshot on the tablet itself. 

<div align="center">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/SN2oZ7ywFNY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Either way is fine. Each pair should take screen shots to share with the group. You can email the screenshot to yourself straight from the device.

### The Audience

The team's separate applications should tell a common story; therefore, we assume that there is a particular audience or user who will find these games interesting. Describe the person your games are attempting to appeal to, and in support of that description, present one [persona](http://www.usabilityfirst.com/glossary/persona/) that exemplifies your target audience.

Your persona should describe (at least) the following five characteristics of your team's fictitious user:

1. **What they look like**. If need be, use an image from the WWW or Flickr to capture what you think your target user might look like.

1. **Their attitude towards life and the world**. Is this a positive person? Outgoing? What are they like?

1. **Background**. Where do they come from? What kind of education and upbringing did they have?

1. **How they feel about the subject at hand**. Are they interested in college life at all? What interests/emotions do they bring to bear in this scenario.

1. **Personality and quirks**. What makes this person unique or interesting? What about them will help us believe they're "real?"

### The Pitch

You are seeking support to develop your games further; to do that, you need to convince investors from the firm of [Dewey, Cheatem, and Howe](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Car_Talk_Dewey%2C_Cheetham_%26_Howe.jpg) to fund the next round of development.

Present a 5-slide pitch. You want to impress DC&H with your focus, because the three of them know: the more you say, the more likely <strike>your swindle will be caught</strike> you'll forget what you were talking about.

#### Slide 1: Title Slide

Your app's names, the name of your Entrepreneur, and the date go on this slide.

#### Slide 2: The Team

DC&H are impressed by teams. Use your tablet to take a picture of each member of the team for this slide. 

#### Slide 3: The Story

You are allowed 10 words (max) on this slide, but as many images as you'd like.  Why did you choose the animation that you did?

#### Slide 4: The Game

This slide is a lie; give us two or three slides, title and image only, that let you show off your animations in 30 seconds or less.

#### Slide 5: The Audience

Who is this app for? With a few words and a picture, help us understand who this app is for.

#### For Submission

This portion has two parts. The first should be a short Google Docs presentation that, when presented, lasts no more than 2-3 minutes. You will also want to have a short (2-3 paragraphs) written version of the pitch for inclusion in the report. 

Include in your report a link that anyone who uses it can actually see the presentation.

### Conclusion

A good conclusion takes us back to the initial premise, ties in key highlights from the report, and helps us see why the original purpose was met. In this case, why both the apps your team developed are appropriate/interesting games.

## Role Contributions

For this project, each role needs to contribute uniquely to the overall project. There is a report and presentation that needs to be put together for submission.

### Process Lead

The introduction and conclusion should be written by the PL. The PL is also responsible for guiding conversation about the report and making sure that deadlines are met so that the DL can bring everything together.

If you use Google Drive, you can **Download As** and create a **PDF** of your final report.

### Advocate

The "Audience" section should be written by the advocate.

### Documentation Lead

The DL is responsible for bringing together the entire document, and inserting screen grabs of each application. However, it might be easier if each pair takes their own screenshots, and simply sends the image to the DL. 

### Entrepreneur

The "Pitch" portion of the report falls to the Entrepreneur. This includes the presentation, which you might be called on in class to present!

Please make sure your title slide has your team name and everyone's name and role on it!

## Submission

The Documentation Lead is responsible for the submission of the final report. It will be due at the end of Team Time on {% duein 0 %}. This means you can make sure, as a group, that everything is named correctly at the beginning of class.

* We recommend you do your writing in Google Drive. This means that you only need to select "Download As" to get your report in a format that is ready for submission.

* We recommend you do your presentation in Google Drive. You can also download that as a PDF, and it it, too, will be ready for submission.

* You should have shared your applications with each other in Google Drive. 

At this point, when you come into class, you should have all the pieces you need for submission in Google Drive.

The **Documentation Lead should submit** the following two pieces on behalf of the entire team:

* *teamname*-coinflip-report.pdf <br/>
The report described above.

* *teamname*-coinflip-pitch.pdf <br/>
The pitch presentation.

Each team member should submit the application they wrote as an individual. It should be named as follows:

* *teamname*-*username1*-*username2*-coinflip.zip <br/>

Note that the game submissions includes both your team name and the usernames of each of the pair partners in the filename.
