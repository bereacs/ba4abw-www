## Objective

1. Improve an existing "coin-flipping" app by adding an animation
1. Gain practive in reading and improve existing code

## Coin Flipping App

Matt wanted a coin flipping app, so he downloaded some code from [Trinity College](http://www.cs.trincoll.edu/~ram/cpsc110/tutorials/faircoin/hw-faircoin.html).  He made a few changes, but it is still pretty boring! (**Note**: Matt knows the professor at Trinity who wrote this app, and isn't trying to make any personal comments about the code, really.)

We need you to help Matt improve this code. He would really like it if the app had some kind of *animation*.  As another example, wouldn't be better to be able to shake the phone to flip the coin instead of pushing the button?  or maybe both? Or perhaps there is a better "thing" to animate and randomize instead of a coin?

You can grab a zip file of the [source code to get you started from our site]({{site.media}}/CoinFlipping.zip).

## Brainstorming

**Your team should first brainstorm a list of animations and improvements you wish to make and then select two of these to implement**. 

Feel free to do this as a full team, and then pick your favorite two ideas to work on in pairs.

## Required Elements 

To be considered an "average" app, you must:

* Use the Clock
* Have Multiple Moving ImageSprite components and/or can be manipulated by the user
* Have procedures to implement common behavior sequences
* Loops to repeat behaviors (perhaps a loop around a procedure call)

To be considered more than "average," your app should also:

* Handle collisions (between sprites, or with the sides of the screen, or both)
* Have Randomness
* Use Vibration

One way to filter your ideas (or, to explore them further) is to think in terms of the things you know how to do.

## Filtering Based on Time

Although this is not a full-team project, your Process Lead should help keep an eye on the "ambition level." Once the pairs in your team have found projects they want to do, you should be asking your team "Can we do this in a week?" While your programmers may be excited to explore something cool, you need to ask the hard questions, and keep people from trying to take on too much in too little time.

The goal of this exercise is to 1) do something cool, and 2) practice using the concepts that we've required above. You saw these things in the Ladybug game; now, we're applying them in a slightly different context (animating coins/dice/etc.).

## The Report

Along with your applications, your pair needs to submit a short report. It should have the following structure:

### Identification

The first part of each pair's report MUST be:

* Your team's name
* The name of every team member, and their role
* The names in the pair submitting this report
* The date the report was submitted

Every report should have a clear title that connects it to the project you are submitting.

### Introduction

The report should begin with a short introduction that makes clear to the reader the task your pair undertook and the thematic approach the group took in its app development.

### App Descriptions

There should be a brief description of each app (2-4 paragraphs). 

Include a screen shot of each app while running. There are two ways you could do this:

1. Take a screenshot while it is running in Bluestacks. You did this in the previous assignment. (**TUTORIAL**: You can use the [Windows 7 snipping tool to do this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmR7k65gtM4).)

1. Take a screenshot on the tablet itself. 

<div align="center">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/SN2oZ7ywFNY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Either way is fine. Each pair should take screen shots to share with the group. You can email the screenshot to yourself straight from the device.

### The Live Pitch

Instead of doing presentations, we'll do a live round-robin in-class where we all wander around and look at other people's animations. So, it isn't so much a "pitch" as a "show-and-tell." (During Team Time on {% duein 0 %}, you should package the app for the tablet so you can run it "disconnected" from your laptop.)

### Critical Concepts

This section should discuss the critical concepts that your app implements. At the least, you should discuss:

* The role of the Clock in your app
* How you handled collisions
* What procedures you wrote and how they simplified your code
* The role of looping in your app

We highly recommend that both you and your teammate work together on this part of the report: you both want to read, discuss, and wrestle with explaining (together!) the role of these elements in your code.

## Submission

You should decide up front which of the two of you (in your pair) will be responsible for the submission of the report. It will be due at the end of Team Time on {% duein 0 %}. This means you can make sure, as a pair, that everything is named correctly at the beginning of class. 

* We recommend you do your writing in Google Drive. This means that you only need to select "Download As" to get your report in a format that is ready for submission.

* You should have shared your applications with each other in Google Drive. 

At this point, when you come into class, you should have all the pieces you need for submission in Google Drive.

You'll submit just one piece: the report.

* *teamname*-*username1*-*username2*-coinflip-report.pdf <br/>

Each team member should submit the application they wrote with their partner. It should be named as follows:

* *teamname*-*username1*-*username2*-coinflip.zip <br/>

Note that the app submissions includes both your team name and the usernames of each of the pair partners in the filename.
