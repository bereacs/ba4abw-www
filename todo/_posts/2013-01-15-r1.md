This reading is a broad overview of computing architecture. You won't understand everything to start with, but it will help lay a foundation for future learning.

### Questions

As part of your active reading process, you should consider and include responses the following 3 questions:

1. As you are reading, you should make note of terms or parts of a computer system that you still feel you do not understand. Use YouTube and see if you can find a video that answers your question, include URl(s) to those videos in your response, and summarize (briefly) why it answered your question(s).

1. Is your laptop a SIMD or MIMD machine? Why?

1. Look up the hardware description of the [Arduino Uno](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno) online. Which elements of a computing system (based on your understanding from the chapter) do you expect you will **not** encounter while working with the Arduino?
