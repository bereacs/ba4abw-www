### Objective

In this assignment, we again ask you to **read and learn about making another app**. As before, you are *strongly encouraged* to actually build the app while doing the reading. 

<span style="color:green;">OK</span>: Read, then build the app.

<span style="color:green;">OK</span>: Build as you go.

<span style="color:red;">NOT OK</span>: Read without programming.


### Active Reading Tasks

1. Go to Resources area of our Moodle site.  Download **ch03-MoleMash.pdf** from the **App\_Inventor\_Chapters** folder as well as the image **ch03\_mole.png** which is located in the **App\_Inventor\_Media** folder.

1. Read this using the [{{site.short}} Active Reading Support Environment]({{site.base}}/infra/active-reading-process/).

### Reflection and Rumination

While you are encouraged to program with a partner, we similarly encourage you to do your writing individually. You may, of course, discuss these questions while you work, but you should sit down, separately, to record your thoughts and responses.

1. The Canvas component makes use of an x-y coordinate system.  Summarize how it works.  What does x represent in this component?  What does y represent?

1. Describe what an ImageSprite component is and why you might want to use one.

1. The X and Y property of an ImageSprite specify the location of the sprite. But a sprite is bigger than a single point, so explain what X and Y really denote.

1. The MoleMash tutorial asks you to define a procedure.  Do you think one could have created the MoleMash app's functionality without defining the procedure?  If so, why do you think the procedure was defined?


### Submission

There are two pieces to submit: the active reading response and a .zip. (Creating the .zip is a process described on page 15 of chapter 1.)
