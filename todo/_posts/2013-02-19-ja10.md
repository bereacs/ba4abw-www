## Task

Read Chapters 14 *Understanding an App's Architecture* and 15 *Engineering and Debugging an App*. As always, you can find these in Moodle in the folder **App\_Inventor\_Chapters** under Resources.

## Objectives

1. Learn about good practices in design and implementation of apps.
1. Learn more about event handlers.

## How to Read in {{site.short}}

Before you dive into the assignment, please first read about the [{{site.short}} Active Reading Support Environment]({{site.base}}/infra/active-reading-process/). We ask you to apply that process to this reading.

## Reflection and Rumination

1. Chapter 14 explains that traditionally, software has often been compared to a recipe.  Explain in detail giving examples of why most apps donâ€™t entirely fit the recipe paradigm anymore.

1. An App Inventor app can be thought of as a set of event handlers. This model is sometimes called event-driven programming. Describe in your own words how the event-driven model works. How do the "recipes" (i.e., algorithms) that characterize the traditional model of programming fit into the event-driven model?

1. For each of the following software development principles and describe briefly how it works and why it is important in software development:
* Involve prospective users in app development.
* Build a simple prototype.
* Code and test your app in small increments.
* Design the app's logic before writing the code.
* Divide, Layer, and Conquer
* Comment your blocks.
* Learn to trace your app by hand.
