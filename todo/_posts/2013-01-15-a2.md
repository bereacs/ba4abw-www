### Task

Read chapters 1-4 of *Rocket Surgery Made Easy*.

### Objectives

This reading lays a foundation for discussing and practicing the design of mobile applications. 

### How to Read in {{site.short}}

As a reminder, you will be using the [{{site.short}} Active Reading Support Environment]({{site.base}}/infra/active-reading-process/). Please apply that process to your reading here.

If you find it is useful to use one copy of the {{arse.expanded}} for each chapter, and then combine them into one document when you are done, that's just fine. 

### Reflection and Rumination

At the end of the {{arse.expanded}} you'll find space to address reflection questions. Keep these in mind as you're engaged in the reading; our intent is that, by answering them, they help you extract more value from the reading.

1. When you were [watching the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QckIzHC99Xc), what three usability problems did you make note of in the website? Were those similar to Steve's? If they were different, explain why you chose the ones you did?

2. The course website, as you all know, is *perfect*. That said, some things may be easier to do/find than others. 

    a. List 5-8 tasks that you might typically use our course website for.
    
    b. List 5-8 tasks you might use our course Moodle site for. Some of these might be the same.
    
    c. Which of those tasks are easier on the course website, and which are easier on Moodle? Why is that?

1. You have been hired to lay out the sidewalks on a college campus. Based on what you have read in RSME so far, how would you go about this task? Describe your process, and what kind of solution you think would result.

1. You've hired Krug to stop by the chocolate factory. Specifically, you want him to help you evaluate your stove design. First, describe your group's stove design---please include a diagram of your stove. (You can use MS Paint to draw it, or if you want, take a picture with a phone, etc.) Then, come up with 3-5 tasks do you think Krug might ask the Oompa-Loompas to do using your stove. What might be some of the results from those tests? And, how do you think you might improve your stove based on those results?
