### Task

Our very first experience making an app.

### Objectives

We will begin working with the App Inventor Environment.

### Using App Inventor 

Working with your partner, we are going to develop an app which uses buttons to allow the user to change the background color.  It is not that exciting, but it will introduce some very useful functionality.

Go to [http://beta.appinventor.mit.edu/](http://beta.appinventor.mit.edu/) and login to your Google/Gmail account.

After login, you should see the App Inventor Projects page, with no projects in it yet. Your empty project page should look like this:

<div align="center">
<img src="{{site.base}}/images/app-inventor-projects.png" alt="App Inventor Welcome"/>
</div>

Push the New button.  Make a project named ***username*-ButtonDemo**, where you should use *your* username in the project name.  

The area you are in when you start app inventor is called the "design area."  It has Palette, Viewer, Components, and Properties areas. 

Use dragging from the palette area to the viewer area to add two buttons to the screen.

In the properties area:

* Change the text which shows on these buttons to "Red Background" and "Green Background."

* Change the background colors of each button to an appropriate color.  

* Set the width of each button to "fill parent."  (Since Androids are all different sizes, this will make it span across.)

In the components area:

* rename the buttons button_red and button_green.

When you have the layout to your liking, you will want to develop functionality.  To develop functionality, you will need the blocks editor, so push the "Open the Blocks Editor" button.

This will launch Java which may take time.  Please be patient.

In the Blocks Editor, on the left you will see tabs with drawers:

<div align="center">
<img src="{{site.base}}/images/appinventor-drawers.png" alt="App Inventor Drawers"/>
</div>

Each of these tabs has a set of drawers which each contains blocks of code you can use.

Because we have made two buttons, we will want to drag out code related to those.  Since we made the buttons, the code is under the "My Blocks" tab.  Clicking on that and on button_red will give you choices of code related to button_red. 

On the My Blocks tab:

* Drag out button_red.Click which will allow us to make something happen when button_red is clicked.

* Drag out the "set Screen1.BackgroundColor to" block.

On the Built-in Tab:

* Drag out color green and color red blocks.

By right-clicking on any block, you can add a comment balloon.  These are designed to help humans better understand. :)

Put all these pieces together as follows:

<div align="center">
<img src="{{site.base}}/images/buttondemo.png" alt="App Inventor button clicks"/>.
</div>

Next, let's test.

If you want to use BlueStacks for your emulator, launch BlueStacks.  Do this first before trying to connect.

If you can't install BlueStacks, there is a built-in emulator you can use.  It is quite a bit slower, but it will work.

Then under "Connect to device" choose the emulator.  You may have to wait a minute or two, but your app should appear on the screen.

If you find the screen orientation frustrating, you can freeze it in portrait mode as follows:

<div align="center">
<img src="{{site.base}}/images/ai-freeze-in-portrait.png" alt="App Inventor freeze in portrait"/>
</div>

This has the advantage on an actual tablet of keeping the Android from changing the orientation as the tablet is moved.

### Your task

Now that you have a sense of how to use App Inventor.  With your partner, make some changes:

* Try making a label. 

* Try moving pieces around.

* Try the layouts tool.

* See what else you can do with a button. What else can you change?  

* The pair with the coolest changes gets a silly prize.
