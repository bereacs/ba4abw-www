### Task

Read Chapter 16, *Reading Your App's Memory*. You can find this in Moodle in the folder **App\_Inventor\_Chapters** under Resources.

### Objectives

1. Learn about how we can use variables to store information.
1. Study common ways that we change variables; for example, creating a counter.

### How to Read in {{site.short}}

Before you dive into the assignment, please first read about the [{{site.short}} Active Reading Support Environment]({{site.base}}/infra/active-reading-process/). We ask you to apply that process to this reading.

### Reflection and Rumination

1. You are talking to a friend or family member who has never done any programming. You're trying to describe what a *variable* is. First tell us who your friend is, and then the description (or analogy, or diagrams) you use to describe things to them. (**BONUS**: Actually do this, and also report on how well the description worked.)

1. Lets say you want to have a counter that goes up by ten every time a button is clicked. What would that code look like? In words, provide the clearest description you can of how you would do this in App Inventor.

1. Write down the clearest set of steps you can for defining a variable in App Inventor. Lets say you were writing an app that took attendance: name the variable **varStudentCount**.

1. Imagine your application has two variables, **varUK** and **varOSU**. Write a bit of code in App Inventor that does the following:
    1. Define both variables.
    1. If UK scores more points than OSU, the background should turn blue.
