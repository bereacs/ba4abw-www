### Objective

1. Capture 1-3 pictures and 1-3 sounds that can be used to tell a story. The sounds should be no longer than 10 seconds each.
1. Be ready to engage in making a Berea App in our next class.

#### "Tell a Story?"

Berea is a special place. Find one or more sights and sounds that you could use to put together an app that tells a really short story. That might be a story of a funny or special moment in your life at Berea, or just someplace that you like to sit and think.

Your laptops are capable of recording sound, and we think that, amongst your team, you'll have a way of taking pictures. Talk to us if that is not the case.

#### "Be Ready?"

You should have written [Hello, Purr!]({{site.base}}/todo/a3/) as part of your homework for {% duein 0%}, which would prepare you to work with your team on developing a similar application as a group.

### Submission

There is no submission for this particular assignment, but you will need these resources in class. So, failure to arrive in class with these resources will leave you unable to work with your team on our in-class activities on {% duein 0 %}.
