### Objective

1. Create a series of four applications that tell a story together.
1. Document the process, and prepare a pitch regarding your team's creation.

There are tasks for each member of your team in this project.

### "All Swim"

**Every member of the team needs to create an application that tells a story**. If you need to support each-other in this task, you are welcome and encouraged to do so. 

Remember that you will ultimately be expected to be able to demonstrate your ability to use App Inventor individually, so make sure that you are learning how to write code as you go.

### The Report

Along with your applications, you need to submit a short report. It should have the following structure:

#### Introduction

Your report should begin with a short introduction that makes clear to the reader the task you undertook and the thematic approach your group took in its application development.

#### Application Descriptions

There should be a brief description of each application, making clear the story behind the images and sounds used in the application (3-4 paragraphs). 

You should also include a screen shot of each application running in the emulator. (You can use the [Windows 7 snipping tool to do this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmR7k65gtM4). Search YouTube for "windows 7 screenshot" for more examples/ideas of how to do this.)

#### The Audience

Each of these applications might appeal to a different audience, or perhaps they were chosen because they present a compelling story to one audience in particular. Describe the audience you are attempting to appeal to, and in support of that description, present one [persona](http://www.usabilityfirst.com/glossary/persona/) that exemplifies your target audience.

Your persona should describe (at least) the following five characteristics of your fictitious user:

1. **What they look like**. If need be, use an image from the WWW or Flickr to capture what you think your target user might look like.

1. **Their attitude towards life and the world**. Is this a positive person? Outgoing? What are they like?

1. **Background**. Where do they come from? What kind of education and upbringing did they have?

1. **How they feel about the subject at hand**. Are they interested in college life at all? What interests/emotions do they bring to bear in this scenario.

1. **Personality and quirks**. What makes this person unique or interesting? What about them will help us believe they're "real?"

#### The Pitch

Why is this combination of stories particularly compelling? Should we use this combination of applications to tell part of Berea's story? Why or why not? Present a case based on the quality of the work and its applicability to the target audience that makes clear to us that your applications should be showcased in some way. 

Remember, an effective pitch does not appeal to emotion: it appeals to fact and evidence wherever possible. Use research from the 'net to support your case.

This portion has two parts. The first should be a short Powerpoint presentation that, when presented, lasts no more than 2-3 minutes. You will also want to have a short (2-3 paragraphs) written version of the pitch for inclusion in the report.

#### Conclusion

A good conclusion takes us back to the initial premise, and ties in key highlights from the report, and helps us see why the original purpose was met. In this case, why are your apps an appropriate/interesting story to tell to the world about Berea.

### Role Contributions

For this project, each role needs to contribute uniquely to the overall project. There is a report and presentation that needs to be put together for submission.

#### Process Lead

The introduction and conclusion should be written by the PL. The PL is also responsible for guiding conversation about the report and making sure that deadlines are met so that the DL can bring everything together.

Given that these parts are all interrelated, the PL should help keep everyone talking and sharing. It may be a good idea for everyone to [use Google Docs to write their reports](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epJi5qUw1rc). You can create text documents as well as presentations using this tool. 

If you use Google Docs, you can do a **Download As** from the Google Docs interface to get a version for submission. If you do this, you can **use the PDF option**, which should preserve the look of your document as much as possible.

#### Advocate

The "Audience" section should be written by the advocate.

#### Documentation Lead

The DL is responsible for bringing together the entire document, and inserting screen grabs of each application. This means everyone needs to send you a .ZIP of their application, so you can load it into App Inventor, run it on the emulator, and take screen grabs.

#### Entrepreneur

The "Pitch" portion of the report.

### Submission

You need to [submit a .zip file containing all of the parts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmV5NC7tVbU) of your application. That zipfile should be called ***teamname*-myberea.zip**.

Inside of the zipfile, you should have the following files:

* *teamname*-report.docx <br/>
The report described above. You can also submit this as a PDF file (in case you chose to use Google Docs).

* *teamname*-pitch.pptx <br/>
The pitch presentation. You can also submit this as a PDF file (in case you chose to use Google Docs).

* *username*-myberea.zip (x4)<br/>
The zipfile should contain a .zip of each application written by each member of the team.

Yes, the zipfile will contain four other zipfiles. While it seems *crazy*, we think it [just might work](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw16FXp5ZJk).

The Documentation Lead is responsible for the submission of the final report. It will be due at the end of Team Time on {% duein 0 %}.
