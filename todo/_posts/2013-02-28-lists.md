### Task

Read Chapter 19, *Programming Lists of Data*. You can find this in Moodle in the folder **App\_Inventor\_Chapters** under Resources.

### Objectives

1. Learn about how we can use lists to store and access information.
1. See a common way that we access a list, namely by stepping through it.

### How to Read in {{site.short}}

The active reading response environment is temporarily suspended while it is under construction. In the meantime, a Word document (or PDF, if you're exporting from Google Docs, or .odt, if you're using Open Office) is just fine.

Make sure to include the name of the assignment, your name, email, and the date in the document you create.

### Reflection and Rumination

1. Suppose that you are talking to a friend or family member who has never done any programming. You're trying to describe what a *list* is. First tell us who your friend is, and then give a description which you will use to describe what a list is to him or her. 

1. Using the same friend or family member, explain what an index is and why it might be necessary is you have a list.

1. Using the same friend, explain what code dependency is and why you generally want to avoid it.

Before answering the rest of these questions, grab a zip file of the [Paint Pot with List]({{site.media}}/PaintPot_with_list.zip).  Upload this source into App Inventor so you can work with it.

1. In this newest version of PaintPot with List, describe specifically what the list in this code is used for.

1. Add a new item to this list. Describe what item you added and also describe all of the changes you needed to make in order for the code to work without any errors.

1. Suppose you wanted to create this version of PaintPot with similar functionality but without a list.  What would need to change in the layout?  What would need to change in the code?  Explain.
