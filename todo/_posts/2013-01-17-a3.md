### Objective

In this assignment, we ask you to **read and learn about making an app**. You are *strongly encouraged* to actually build the app while doing the reading. 

It is actually OK if you do the reading and *then* build the app described. However, it is NOT OK if you just do the reading and don't actually build the app.

### Active Reading Tasks

1. Go to Resources area of our Moodle site.  Download both ch00-forwardAndPreface.pdf and ch01-HelloPurr.pdf from the App_Inventor_Chapters folder.  You may also want to download both ch01_kitty.png and ch01_meow.mp3 from the App_Inventor_Media folder.

1. Read these using the [{{site.short}} Active Reading Support Environment]({{site.base}}/infra/active-reading-process/).

1. <em>Note that ch01_meow.mp3 is a sound which is short in duration.  If you decide you want to use a longer sound, you will need to use the *Player* instead of the *Sound* from the Palette area.</em>

### Reflection and Rumination

1. What kinds of things will you be able to do after working through the projects described in the chapter? 

1. What are the three key parts that are needed to make App Inventor work?

1. What is the difference between the *Viewer* and the *Palette* in App Inventor?

1. What picture did you use in your app, and why? Matt used [LimeCat](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/limecat), which he insists is the very definition of Cat memes, but you might prefer [happy cat](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/happy-cat) or even [long cat](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/longcat). If you are independently minded, you may have used some other cat. Regardless, include the image you chose in your writeup.
