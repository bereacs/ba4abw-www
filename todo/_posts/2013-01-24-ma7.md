### Task

Read chapters 7, 8, and 9 in Krug's *Rocket Science Made Easy*.

### Objectives

1. Be familiar with the checklists presented in chapter 7.
1. Learn how to structure a lightweight usability test.
1. Feel prepared to run your first usability test.

### How to Read in {{site.short}}

Before you dive into the assignment, please first read about the [{{site.short}} Active Reading Support Environment]({{site.base}}/infra/active-reading-process/). We ask you to apply that process to your reading of the syllabus.

### Reflection and Rumination

At the end of the {{arse.expanded}} you'll find space to address reflection questions. Keep these in mind as you're engaged in the reading; our intent is that, by answering them, they help you extract more value from the reading.

1. Your programming pair is about to develop a new game based on our readings and explorations in Wolber's text. While the game that you create is obviously *amazing*, it probably could use some testing. What questions are you going to ask your user before they start? (Page 75.)

1. Develop a list of 6 tasks that you think are appropriate for the user of your software to carry out (page 76). For each task, describe how you think they might struggle with this task.

1. Krug assumes you are testing websites on a laptop or desktop computer; you will be testing a game on a tablet. Describe a process (based on chapter 8) that you think will work well for testing tablet-based software.

1. Why does Krug say "with apologies to Elisabeth Kubler-Ross?" Who is she? What contribution to the study of psychology did she make, and why is it relevant here?

1. Your observers will be watching someone use a touchscreen device. What should your observer's note sheet look like? Does it look the same as Krug's? Should it have little drawings of tablets so they can mark where people click? Propose two or three things that you think should be the same (and/or different) on the observer sheets that you'll use for testing tablet-based applications.
