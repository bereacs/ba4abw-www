### Task

In this assignment, we ask you to **read and reflect on the syllabus**.

### Objectives

1. Read the syllabus.
1. Consider the course policies.
1. Reflect on points for personal growth and learning.

### How to Read in {{site.short}}

Before you dive into the assignment, please first read about the [{{site.short}} Active Reading Support Environment]({{site.base}}/infra/active-reading-process/). We ask you to apply that process to your reading of the syllabus.

### Reflection and Rhumination

At the end of the {{arse.expanded}} you'll find space to address reflection questions. Keep these in mind as you're engaged in the reading; our intent is that, by answering them, they help you extract more value from the reading.

1. What aspects of the course are likely to best support the way you are accustomed to learning? Why?

1. What aspects of the course are most likely to challenge you to grow and learn in new ways? Why?

1. Which learning objectives for {{site.short}} are most important to you? Which are most important to employers? Are these unique to computing? (You may want to Google around; [Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CollegeAdvice.html) is a good place to start.)
