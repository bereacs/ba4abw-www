### Task

Test two websites intended for student use.

### Objectives

Affirm that they're both awesome, so as not to hurt the professors' feelings.
Just kidding... We actually want you to learn to run some lightweight usability tests.

### Two Sites, One Student

There are students out there who have to use multiple websites created by the same professor(s). It is unfortunate, but true.

Some of those sites are *awesome*, and some are *super double awesome*. That said, some students have spoken up and suggested that one of those sites was *less awesome* than it could be. They have been punished. (not really.)

Your task, today, is to look at these two sites, and reaffirm how awesome both sites are. 

### In Three Steps

First, look at the sites and come up with three tasks. Second, swap around the room so as to test someone from another group. Finally, affirm to your professors that the websites they produce are amazing. *cough* Er, step three, summarize your observations in a Google Doc.

#### 1. Generate Tasks

Take a look at these two websites:

* [http://craftofelectronics.org/](http://craftofelectronics.org/)
* [http://berea.mobi/courses/ba4abw-sp13/](http://berea.mobi/courses/ba4abw-sp13/)

Come up with 3 tasks that a student might want to use those websites for. Write them down, so you don't forget.

The Documentation Lead and Advocate will serve as observers, the Process Lead will run the test.

#### 2. Swap and Test

The Entrepreneur should rotate up to the next team. That is, team Astro Boy's Entrepreneur should go to team Bender, Bender' Entrepreneur to Cupcake, and so on. Team Jelly Bean's Entrepreneur should rotate down to Astro Boy.

Run a short usability test with your questions on each website. This means you will ask the same three questions of the user on each website, yielding six answers.

#### 3. Return and Report

Discuss amongst your team the results of your test. 

Then, open up our shared [Website Usability Report]({{page.usabilityLink}}) document, find your team's section, and put in the questions you asked and the results you came up with. 

### Conclusion

We are doing this activity because we genuinely want to improve the usability of the tools we ask you to use, and this is an easy way for you to practice some lightweight usability testing after reading Krug chapters 7-9. And, the results will give us useful information that will benefit you when we try and improve the site based on your testing. **We seriously do expect you to find things that don't work well with our websites!**
