1. Be able to identify possible uses of databases.
1. Learn the basic vocabulary of databases (table, row, column, primary key)

## How to Read in {{site.short}}

The response environment is temporarily suspended while it is under construction. In the meantime, a Word document (or PDF, if you're exporting from Google Docs, or .odt, if you're using Open Office) is just fine.

Make sure to include the name of the assignment, your name, email, and the date in the document you create.

## Reflection and Rumination

1. Develop three true/false questions that you think might appear on a quiz or exam capturing the critical concepts from the above videos.

1. Develop three multiple-choice questions that challenge your understanding of the material in the videos above. (A good multiple choice question has more than one *plausible* answer, but only one right answer.)

1. What kind of information in the world do you find fascinating? Do you collect [PEZ dispensers](http://www.pez.com/index.php)? Follow sports? Keep track of quotes in a group of friends? Propose how you might keep track of that information using one or more database tables. Keep in mind the idea of using a **primary key**, or **unique identifier**, in each table to make sure that you can't have any (exact) duplicate rows in your DB.
