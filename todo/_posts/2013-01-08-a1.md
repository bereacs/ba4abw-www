### Download the Book

The first half of the course textbook, *Elements of Computing Systems* (or *EoCS*, as I often abbreviate it), is available online. Download chapters 1-6; you can download the lecture notes if you wish.

[http://www.nand2tetris.org/course.php](http://www.nand2tetris.org/course.php)

If you want to purchase the text, it is available on Amazon for $25. Personally, I think it is an excellent text, and recommend it highly. So, if you prefer having a paper text, I consider *EoCS* to be an excellent resource.

### Buy an Arduino

1. Do nothing.
1. Pick up an Arduino from me.
1. PROFIT!

You will be charged $20 +/- $5 (actual amount to be announced) by Ms. Sandy Wells. I will give you an Arduino kit. Easy-peasy.


### Install Arduino Development Environment

Download and install the Arduino IDE.

[http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

You should be able to open it; you won't be able to test it further without an Arduino.

### Install the Nand2Tetris Suite

Download the suite of emulators for the course.

[http://www.nand2tetris.org/software.php](http://www.nand2tetris.org/software.php)

You should be able to launch it, and see a programming environment of sorts. If you can't do that, there are some technical issues we need to overcome.

### Create a BitBucket Account
We will be using BitBucket as our host for version control this term. Our preferred version control system will be Git.

#### Create the Account

Go to [bitbucket.org](bitbucket.org). Create an account.

You can create an account using any username you wish. For example, your account could be called **crazzyl33tcoder**, to show off that you are unable to spell, but think you're an amazing programmer. Personally, I recommend using something that you think will show well in a professional context. For example, years ago I settled on **jadudm** as my typical online account name/handle, because it was my username at my undergraduate institution.

You **must use your berea.edu address** when you create this account. The reason for that is...

#### Apply for Educational Account Status

After you create your account, visit this webpage:

[http://www.atlassian.com/software/views/bitbucket-academic-license.jsp](http://www.atlassian.com/software/views/bitbucket-academic-license.jsp)

Fill out the form, and request an educational account. You can probably leave the "additional notes" field blank.

##### NOTE

It is possible that you will *automatically* be granted an educational license if you use your berea.edu email address. I just added my email address to the account, and without filling out this form, my account was magically granted "Academic" status. This may be true for you as well. 

It is important that you have *Academic* status, otherwise you will not be able to collaborate with your classmates on private repositories. You'll learn more about this as part of the course; for now, it is only for you to do, not to understand. Understanding comes later.
