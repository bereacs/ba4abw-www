### Task

First, watch the [d.school brainstorming rules
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1h5L_0rFz8). This 2m30s video does a nice job of demonstrating an active brainstorming session. They have the same big sheets of paper we do! (The d.school is at Stanford, BTW.)

Brainstorming is a group process for generating creative ideas. The best brainstorming will defer judgment, strive for quantity, capture every idea that comes up (even if it seems crazy or undoable), and combine and build on previously stated ideas.  All team members must restrain from filtering or criticizing.

1. Second, watch [this video from Disney Studios](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtw33b9TCfU) that shows how *not* to do a brainstorming session.

Finally, if you want more of everyone's favorite teammate/labor supervisor, [check out this series](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opplsYSrIHc). But, only when you're done with all of your other work. (This last video will not show up on any exams.)

### Objectives

1. Refresh yourself on what it means to engage in active, creative brainstorming.

### How to Read in {{site.short}}

Actually, no. Not for this one.

### Reflection and Rumination

Nope.

However, if taking some notes will help you, don't be afraid to do so. **This material is fair game for an exam**, even if there is not a reflection. (Except where noted.)

### Submission

Come to class prepared to engage in some brainstorming.
