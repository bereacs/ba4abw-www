### Task

Watch two short videos on brainstorming.

#### Das Videos

1. First, watch the [d.school brainstorming rules
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1h5L_0rFz8). This 2m30s video does a nice job of demonstrating an active brainstorming session. They have the same big sheets of paper we do! (The d.school is at Stanford, BTW.)

1. Second, watch [this video from Disney Studios](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtw33b9TCfU) that shows how *not* to do a brainstorming session.

Finally, if you want more of everyone's favorite teammate/labor supervisor, [check out this series](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opplsYSrIHc). But, only when you're done with all of your other work. (This last video will not show up on any exams.)

### Objectives

1. Refresh yourself on what it means to engage in active, creative brainstorming.

### How to Read in {{site.short}}

Actually, no. Not for this one.

### Reflection and Rumination

Nope.

However, if taking some notes will help you, don't be afraid to do so. **This material is fair game for an exam**, even if there is not a reflection. (Except where noted.)

### Submission

Come to class prepared to engage in some brainstorming.
