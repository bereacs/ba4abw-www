### Objective

1. Brainstorm at least 15 possible games to develop.
1. Implement the two games that seem most engaging and doable given your current expertise.
1. Document the process, and prepare a pitch regarding both of your team's games.

This is a project to be completed as a team, and there are parts of this project for each team member acting in their assigned role.

### Brainstorming

**Your team should first brainstorm a list of games and then select two games to create**. 

In App Inventor, we currently know how to control the screen layout and how to use:

* Buttons
* The Canvas for drawing
* Media (eg. sounds and images)
* Screen drags
* Screen touches
* Variables to remember things

After the [Mole Mash!]({{site.todo}}/ja8/) assignment, you'll have explored:

* An actual Android tablet for live development
* Addition and subtraction (such as is often needed for keeping score in a game)
* The Clock (which is often needed for time-sensitive activities in a game)
* The ImageSprite component which can be used to make touch-sensitive movable images
* Procedures to implement repeated behaviors (i.e. looping)
* Randomness
* Vibration

Brainstorming is a group process for generating creative ideas. The best brainstorming will defer judgment, strive for quantity, capture every idea that comes up (even if it seems crazy or undoable), and combine and build on previously stated ideas.  All team members must restrain from filtering or criticizing. **The Documentation Lead should write down all game ideas brainstorming generated during brainstorming.**  The entire list of ideas ideas generated during your brainstorming process should go into the report.

### Select Designs

Based on the ideas generated during brainstorming, select the most promising two ideas.

Remember that each of you will ultimately be expected to create your game in App Inventor, so make sure that you select two games you believe you can implement.

### Prototype Implementation

In pairs, create prototype implementations of your games. Then use the lightweight usability protocol to test your prototypes so you can improve upon them.

### The Report

Along with your applications, your team needs to submit a short report. It should have the following structure:

#### Identification

The first part of every team report MUST be:

* Your team's name
* The name of every team member, and their role
* The date the report was submitted

Every report should have a clear title that connects it to the project you are submitting.

#### Introduction

The report should begin with a short introduction that makes clear to the reader the task your team undertook and the thematic approach the group took in its game development.

#### Game Descriptions

There should be a brief description of each game (3-4 paragraphs). 

Include a screen shot of each game running in the emulator/Bluestacks. (**TUTORIAL**: You can use the [Windows 7 snipping tool to do this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmR7k65gtM4). Search YouTube for "windows 7 screenshot" for more examples/ideas of how to do this.)

Each pair should take screen shots to share with the group.

#### The Audience

The team's separate applications should tell a common story; therefore, we assume that there is a particular audience or user who will find these games interesting. Describe the person your games are attempting to appeal to, and in support of that description, present one [persona](http://www.usabilityfirst.com/glossary/persona/) that exemplifies your target audience.

Your persona should describe (at least) the following five characteristics of your team's fictitious user:

1. **What they look like**. If need be, use an image from the WWW or Flickr to capture what you think your target user might look like.

1. **Their attitude towards life and the world**. Is this a positive person? Outgoing? What are they like?

1. **Background**. Where do they come from? What kind of education and upbringing did they have?

1. **How they feel about the subject at hand**. Are they interested in college life at all? What interests/emotions do they bring to bear in this scenario.

1. **Personality and quirks**. What makes this person unique or interesting? What about them will help us believe they're "real?"

#### The Pitch

Why is this combination of games particularly compelling and fun? These is a representative question; you might expand on it or come up with others that you think are particularly relevant to your team's collection of apps.)

Present a case based on the quality of the work and its applicability to the target audience that makes clear to us that your team's applications should be showcased in some way.

Remember, an **effective pitch does not appeal to emotion**: it appeals to fact and evidence wherever possible. Use research from the 'net to support your case.

This portion has two parts. The first should be a short Powerpoint presentation that, when presented, lasts no more than 2-3 minutes. You will also want to have a short (2-3 paragraphs) written version of the pitch for inclusion in the report. 

#### Conclusion

A good conclusion takes us back to the initial premise, ties in key highlights from the report, and helps us see why the original purpose was met. In this case, why both the apps your team developed are appropriate/interesting games.

### Role Contributions

For this project, each role needs to contribute uniquely to the overall project. There is a report and presentation that needs to be put together for submission.

#### Process Lead

The introduction and conclusion should be written by the PL. The PL is also responsible for guiding conversation about the report and making sure that deadlines are met so that the DL can bring everything together.

Given that these parts are all interrelated, the PL should help keep everyone talking and sharing. ([Google Drive](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epJi5qUw1rc) is a useful tool.) You can create text documents as well as presentations using this tool.

If you use Google Drive, you can **Download As** and create a **PDF** of your final report.

#### Advocate

The "Audience" section should be written by the advocate.

#### Documentation Lead

The DL is responsible for bringing together the entire document, and inserting screen grabs of each application. However, it might be easier if each pair takes their own screenshots, and simply sends the image to the DL. 

#### Entrepreneur

The "Pitch" portion of the report falls to the Entrepreneur. This includes the presentation, which you might be called on in class to present!

Please make sure your title slide has your team name and everyone's name and role on it!

### Submission

The Documentation Lead is responsible for the submission of the final report. It will be due at the end of Team Time on {% duein 0 %}. This means you can make sure, as a group, that everything is named correctly at the beginning of class.

* We recommend you do your writing in Google Drive. This means that you only need to select "Download As" to get your report in a format that is ready for submission.

* We recommend you do your presentation in Google Drive. You can also download that as a PDF, and it it, too, will be ready for submission.

* You should have shared your applications with each other in Google Drive. 

At this point, when you come into class, you should have all the pieces you need for submission in Google Drive.

The **Documentation Lead should submit** the following two pieces on behalf of the entire team:

* *teamname*-gamingtogether-report.pdf <br/>
The report described above.

* *teamname*-gamingtogether-pitch.pdf <br/>
The pitch presentation.

Each team member should submit the application they wrote as an individual. It should be named as follows:

* *teamname*-*username1*-*username2*-gamingtogether.zip <br/>

Note that the game submissions includes both your team name and the usernames of each of the pair partners in the filename.
