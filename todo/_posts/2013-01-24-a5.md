### Task

Review chapter 4 to refresh your brain, and read chapters 5 and 6 in Krug's *Rocket Science Made Easy*.

### Objectives

1. Appreciate the role of users in testing.
1. See how to quickly recruit users for testing.
1. Learn about task identification in the testing process.

### How to Read in {{site.short}}

Before you dive into the assignment, please first read about the [{{site.short}} Active Reading Support Environment]({{site.base}}/infra/active-reading-process/). We ask you to apply that process to your reading of the syllabus.

### Reflection and Rumination

At the end of the {{arse.expanded}} you'll find space to address reflection questions. Keep these in mind as you're engaged in the reading; our intent is that, by answering them, they help you extract more value from the reading.

1. What topics, regardless of whether they are "academic" or not, would you consider yourself a "domain expert" in? Are there any topics where you would like to gain expertise?

1. Consider the people in your current team. What kinds of domain knowledge do you have? This isn't limited to course of study; one of you, for example, may be an extremely experienced weaver. Develop your list from memory, but discuss this during team time, and see what kinds of things you may have missed.

1. What, in the context of testing a mobile application, does it mean to you to test/survey a "diverse" audience? Does this just mean we need to find someone who looks different than we do?

1. What recruiting strategies would you employ to attract participants at Berea College? What if you were studying mobile app use amongst practicing teachers? How would your approaches be similar, and how would they be different?

1. Imagine that we combine our individual My My Berea apps into a single app. How could we do that (visually), and what are two tasks we might ask people to do with the app? Write pilot test scenarios for each of those tasks.
