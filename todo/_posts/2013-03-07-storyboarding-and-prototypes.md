## Read Everything

First, read through the entire assignment. 

Your reading and viewing are to prepare you to do two things:

1. Sketch prototypes of your tour application.
1. Run some practice tests in class on {% duein 0 %}.

## What is a Paper Prototype?

Read the paper titled [Prototyping for Tiny Fingers]({{site.media}}/prototyping-for-tiny-fingers.pdf). You should find that your reading of Krug will make much of this article seem familiar.

## Paper Prototyping Tests

Next, watch these two videos. The first is very short, but not a great example of a paper prototyping test session---but at 1:50, it serves as a quick intro. The second is 8 minutes and is a better example of good paper prototype tests.

The second video is better because you can hear the test guide providing background at the start (introducing the test), explaining (where appropriate) what is happening, and so on.
 
## Your Mission

As a class, [you generated a huge list of possible topics in a Google Doc](http://goo.gl/DWz5m) for a tour app.

### Sketch

First, sketch. Sketch out some ideas about what a tour app might look like. What does the first screen look like? Is there audio/narration? How do you navigate from "place to place" within the app? Can your user choose different destinations, and you'll guide them there?

Come up with sketches for at least 3 different tours that you might imagine people taking.

### Mock Up

In the second video, you saw what the paper prototype looked like in its final form: the team made sure to write neatly, they used color paper to highlight different parts of the app, and care and attention was paid to the quality of their work. It wasn't *perfect*, but it wasn't as sloppy as what we saw in the first video.

Take your favorite sketch, and on one or more 8<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>'' x 11'' pieces of paper, make a large, "paper tablet," and create the elements you would need to run a paper prototyping session of your tour. We have materials in the lab (paper, markers, etc.) if you need them. 

## Submission

Bring your mockup to class on {% duein 0 %}.
