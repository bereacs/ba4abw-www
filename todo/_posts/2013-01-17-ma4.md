### Objective

In this assignment, we ask you to **read and learn about making an app**. You are *strongly encouraged* to actually build the app while doing the reading. 

It is actually OK if you do the reading and *then* build the app described. However, it is NOT OK if you just do the reading and don't actually build the app.

### Active Reading Tasks

1. Go to Resources area of our Moodle site.  Download both ch00-forwardAndPreface.pdf and ch01-HelloPurr.pdf
1. Read these using the [{{site.short}} Active Reading Support Environment]({{site.base}}/infra/active-reading-process/).

### Reflection and Rumination

1. What kinds of things will you be able to do after working through the projects described in the chapter? 

1. What are the three key parts that are needed to make App Inventor work?

1. What is the difference between the *Viewer* and the *Palette* in App Inventor?

1. What picture did you use in your app, and why? Matt used [LimeCat](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/limecat), which he insists is the very definition of Cat memes, but you might prefer [happy cat](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/happy-cat) or even [long cat](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/longcat). If you are independently minded, you may have used some other cat. Regardless, include the image you chose in your writeup.

1. How many milliseconds are in a second? How many milliseconds in 1/4 of a second?
