### Objective

In this assignment, we again ask you to **read and learn about making another app**. As before, you are *strongly encouraged* to actually build the app while doing the reading. However, this chapter seemed a bit too lengthy to do in one go, so we decided to break it up into two parts.  This assignment is part I on pages 37-46.

As before, it is actually OK if you do the reading and *then* build the app described. However, it is NOT OK if you just do the reading and don't actually build the app.

### Active Reading Tasks

1. Go to Resources area of our Moodle site.  Download ch03-MoleMash.pdf from the App_Inventor_Chapters folder as well as the image ch03_mole.png which is located in the App_Inventor_Media folder.

1. Read this using the [{{site.short}} Active Reading Support Environment]({{site.base}}/infra/active-reading-process/).

### Reflection and Rumination

1. The Canvas component makes use of an x-y coordinate system.  Summarize how it works.  What does x represent in this component?  What does y represent?

1. Describe what an ImageSprite component is and why you might want to use one.

1. The X and Y property of an ImageSprite specify the location of the sprite. But a sprite is bigger than a single point, so explain what X and Y really denote.

1. The MoleMash tutorial asks you to define a procedure.  Do you think one could have created the MoleMash app's functionality without defining the procedure?  If so, why do you think the procedure was defined?
