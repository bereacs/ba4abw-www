### Objective

1. Create a series of four applications that tell a story together.
1. Document the process, and prepare a pitch regarding your team's creation.

This is a project to be completed as a team, and there are parts of this project for each team member acting in their assigned role.

### "All Swim"

**Every member of the team needs to create an application that tells a story**. If as a team you need to support each-other in this task, you are welcome and encouraged to do so.

Remember that each of you will ultimately be expected to demonstrate your ability to use App Inventor individually, so make sure that you are learning how to write code as you go.

### The Report

Along with your applications, your team needs to submit a short report. It should have the following structure:

#### Identification

The first part of every team report MUST be:

* Your team's name
* The name of every team member, and their role
* The date the report was submitted

Every report should have a clear title that connects it to the project you are submitting.

#### Introduction

The report should begin with a short introduction that makes clear to the reader the task your team undertook and the thematic approach the group took in its application development.

#### Application Descriptions

There should be a brief description of each application, making clear the story behind the images and sounds used in the application (3-4 paragraphs). 

Include a screen shot of each application running in the emulator/Bluestacks. (**TUTORIAL**: You can use the [Windows 7 snipping tool to do this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmR7k65gtM4). Search YouTube for "windows 7 screenshot" for more examples/ideas of how to do this.)

#### The Audience

The team's separate applications should tell a common story; therefore, we assume that there is a particular audience or user who will find this collection of stories interesting. Describe the person your stories are attempting to appeal to, and in support of that description, present one [persona](http://www.usabilityfirst.com/glossary/persona/) that exemplifies your target audience.

Your persona should describe (at least) the following five characteristics of your team's fictitious user:

1. **What they look like**. If need be, use an image from the WWW or Flickr to capture what you think your target user might look like.

1. **Their attitude towards life and the world**. Is this a positive person? Outgoing? What are they like?

1. **Background**. Where do they come from? What kind of education and upbringing did they have?

1. **How they feel about the subject at hand**. Are they interested in college life at all? What interests/emotions do they bring to bear in this scenario.

1. **Personality and quirks**. What makes this person unique or interesting? What about them will help us believe they're "real?"

#### The Pitch

Why is this combination of stories particularly compelling? Should we use this combination of applications to tell part of Berea's story? Why or why not? (These are representative questions; you might expand on them or come up with others that you think are particularly relevant to your team's collection of apps.)

Present a case based on the quality of the work and its applicability to the target audience that makes clear to us that your team's applications should be showcased in some way.

Remember, an **effective pitch does not appeal to emotion**: it appeals to fact and evidence wherever possible. Use research from the 'net to support your case.

This portion has two parts. The first should be a short Powerpoint presentation that, when presented, lasts no more than 2-3 minutes. You will also want to have a short (2-3 paragraphs) written version of the pitch for inclusion in the report. (**TUTORIAL**: You can use [Google Drive to create your presentation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epJi5qUw1rc), and then save it as a PDF. This might be easier, working in a team context.)

#### Conclusion

A good conclusion takes us back to the initial premise, ties in key highlights from the report, and helps us see why the original purpose was met. In this case, why are the apps your team developed an appropriate/interesting story to tell to the world about Berea and your experience of it.

### Role Contributions

For this project, each role needs to contribute uniquely to the overall project. There is a report and presentation that needs to be put together for submission.

#### Process Lead

The introduction and conclusion should be written by the PL. The PL is also responsible for guiding conversation about the report and making sure that deadlines are met so that the DL can bring everything together.

Given that these parts are all interrelated, the PL should help keep everyone talking and sharing. (**TUTORIAL**: It may be a good idea for everyone to [use Google Drive to write their reports](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epJi5qUw1rc).) You can create text documents as well as presentations using this tool.

If you use Google Drive, you can do a **Download As** from the Google Drive interface to get a version for submission. When you can **use the PDF option**, which should preserve the look of your document as much as possible. Submitting your final report as a PDF is just fine.

**We really recommend you use Google Drive for this project. It will make your life easier.**

#### Advocate

The "Audience" section should be written by the advocate.

#### Documentation Lead

The DL is responsible for bringing together the entire document, and inserting screen grabs of each application. This means everyone needs to send you a .ZIP of their application, so you can load it into App Inventor, run it on the emulator/Bluestacks, and take screen grabs.

#### Entrepreneur

The "Pitch" portion of the report. This includes the presentation, which you might be called on in class to present!

Please make sure your title slide has your team name and everyone's name and role on it!

### Submission

The Documentation Lead is responsible for the submission of the final report. It will be due at the end of Team Time on {% duein 0 %}. This means you can make sure, as a group, that everything is named correctly at the beginning of class.

* We recommend you do your writing in Google Drive. This means that you only need to select "Download As" to get your report in a format that is ready for submission.

* We recommend you do your presentation in Google Drive. You can also download that as a PDF, and it it, too, will be ready for submission.

* You should have shared your applications with each other. You can do this by creating a shared folder in Google Drive. (**TUTORIAL**: Here's a short video about how you can [create a folder that your entire team can upload to and see](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cibw7DO0me4). I searched for "google drive shared folder" in YouTube.)

At this point, when you come into class, you should have all the pieces you need for submission in Google Drive.

The **Documentation Lead should submit** the following two pieces on behalf of the entire team:

* *teamname*-report.pdf <br/>
The report described above.

* *teamname*-pitch.pdf <br/>
The pitch presentation.

Each team member should submit the application they wrote as an individual. It should be named as follows:

* *teamname*-*username*-myberea.zip <br/>
Note that your submission includes both your team name and your username in the filename.

Yes, there is a lot of sharing going on, but it's a useful skill and should make things easier. While it seems *crazy*, we think it [just might work](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw16FXp5ZJk).
