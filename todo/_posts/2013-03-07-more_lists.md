### Task

Read Chapter 8, *Programming Lists of Data*. You can find this in Moodle in the folder **App\_Inventor\_Chapters** under Resources.

### Objectives

1. Learn more about how we can use lists to store and access information.
1. Gain practice with a common way that we step through a list.

### How to Read in {{site.short}}

The active reading response environment is temporarily suspended while it is under construction. In the meantime, a Word document (or PDF, if you're exporting from Google Docs, or .odt, if you're using Open Office) is just fine.

Make sure to include the name of the assignment, your name, email, and the date in the document you create.

### Reflection and Rumination

1. Suppose you work for the company designing this app.  Suppose also that it is being designed to be used by school children.  Fully describe one persona which could be used to guide your design process.

1. The programming in this app has some similarities to the programming in the app created for chapter 19, "PaintPot_with_list". Describe two similarities you believe are significant.  Also describe two differences you believe are significant.  (Be clear about which is which.)

1. Describe what one could do in the code for this app so that when the app starts, the first question will appear along with its corresponding image.

1. Describe what one can do in the code so that when the user clicks the NextButton the first time, the second question appears. When she or he clicks it again, the third question appears, and so on.

1. Describe what one could do in the code so that when the user reaches the last question and clicks the NextButton, the first question will appear again.

1. Describe what one can do in programming so that when the user answers a question, the app will report whether the answer chosen is correct or not.

1. Describe one improvement you would like to incorporate into this app.  Explain why you think this improvement would make the app better.
