### Implementation

In the EoCS environment, implement the following gates in lab:

* And
* Or
* Not
* Xor
* Mux
* DMux

Check in your work at this point and tag your work for submission. You may find [the EoCS project one description](http://nand2tetris.org/01.php) to be of use.

If time allows, you should also work with your partner on:

* Not16
* And16
* Or16

You do not need to include these gates in your submission; they are part of the next assignment.
