### Objective

In this assignment, we again ask you to **read and learn about making an app**. As before, you are *strongly encouraged* to actually build the app while doing the reading. 

It is actually OK if you do the reading and *then* build the app described. However, it is NOT OK if you just do the reading and don't actually build the app.

### Active Reading Tasks

1. Go to Resources area of our Moodle site.  Download ch02-PaintPot.pdf from the App_Inventor_Chapters folder.  You can begin by using the same kitty you used in Chapter 1 (ch01_kitty.png from the App_Inventor_Media folder) or you can use a different kitty picture... or if you really want to psuh the boundaries, you might consider using a picture of a doggie... or something else!

1. Read this using the [{{site.short}} Active Reading Support Environment]({{site.base}}/infra/active-reading-process/).

### Reflection and Rumination

1. In Hello Purr, the button click was the only action the user could take which would trigger an event.  What new user actions are able to be employed in Paint Pot beyond the button click?  How are these new event types useful in this app?

1.  In PaintPot you define a variable which is memory cell in the phone or tablet that the app can access; your author says that you can think of it like a bucket in which you can store data that can vary.  Why did you need to define a variable?  What did your app need to remember?

1. How do you define a variable in App Inventor?  How do you use a variable once you define it?

1. What picture did you finally use in your app, and why? Include the image you chose in your writeup.
