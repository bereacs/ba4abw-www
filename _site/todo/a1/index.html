        <p><strong>Due:</strong> 08 Jan 2013 </p>
        
         <h3 id="download-the-book">Download the Book</h3>

<p>The first half of the course textbook, <em>Elements of Computing Systems</em> (or <em>EoCS</em>, as I often abbreviate it), is available online. Download chapters 1-6; you can download the lecture notes if you wish.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/course.php">http://www.nand2tetris.org/course.php</a></p>

<p>If you want to purchase the text, it is available on Amazon for $25. Personally, I think it is an excellent text, and recommend it highly. So, if you prefer having a paper text, I consider <em>EoCS</em> to be an excellent resource.</p>

<h3 id="buy-an-arduino">Buy an Arduino</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Do nothing.</li>
  <li>Pick up an Arduino from me.</li>
  <li>PROFIT!</li>
</ol>

<p>You will be charged $20 +/- $5 (actual amount to be announced) by Ms. Sandy Wells. I will give you an Arduino kit. Easy-peasy.</p>

<h3 id="install-arduino-development-environment">Install Arduino Development Environment</h3>

<p>Download and install the Arduino IDE.</p>

<p><a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software</a></p>

<p>You should be able to open it; you won’t be able to test it further without an Arduino.</p>

<h3 id="install-the-nand2tetris-suite">Install the Nand2Tetris Suite</h3>

<p>Download the suite of emulators for the course.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/software.php">http://www.nand2tetris.org/software.php</a></p>

<p>You should be able to launch it, and see a programming environment of sorts. If you can’t do that, there are some technical issues we need to overcome.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-bitbucket-account">Create a BitBucket Account</h3>
<p>We will be using BitBucket as our host for version control this term. Our preferred version control system will be Git.</p>

<h4 id="create-the-account">Create the Account</h4>

<p>Go to <a href="bitbucket.org">bitbucket.org</a>. Create an account.</p>

<p>You can create an account using any username you wish. For example, your account could be called <strong>crazzyl33tcoder</strong>, to show off that you are unable to spell, but think you’re an amazing programmer. Personally, I recommend using something that you think will show well in a professional context. For example, years ago I settled on <strong>jadudm</strong> as my typical online account name/handle, because it was my username at my undergraduate institution.</p>

<p>You <strong>must use your berea.edu address</strong> when you create this account. The reason for that is…</p>

<h4 id="apply-for-educational-account-status">Apply for Educational Account Status</h4>

<p>After you create your account, visit this webpage:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/views/bitbucket-academic-license.jsp">http://www.atlassian.com/software/views/bitbucket-academic-license.jsp</a></p>

<p>Fill out the form, and request an educational account. You can probably leave the “additional notes” field blank.</p>

<h5 id="note">NOTE</h5>

<p>It is possible that you will <em>automatically</em> be granted an educational license if you use your berea.edu email address. I just added my email address to the account, and without filling out this form, my account was magically granted “Academic” status. This may be true for you as well. </p>

<p>It is important that you have <em>Academic</em> status, otherwise you will not be able to collaborate with your classmates on private repositories. You’ll learn more about this as part of the course; for now, it is only for you to do, not to understand. Understanding comes later. </p>
