<h2 id="course-objectives">Course Objectives</h2>

<p><strong>FIXME</strong>: To be written. (December 2, 2012)</p>

<p>Italicized objectives may be expressed differently in the first offering of CSC 186.</p>

<h2 id="materials-online">Materials Online</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We will use Moodle, provided by Berea College, for handing in assignments.</li>
  <li>We can use <a href="http://dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> for making sure we never lose our work.</li>
  <li>We will use <a href="http://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a> for version control.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="required-text-and-materials">Required Text and Materials</h2>

<p>The following are <strong>required</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/">The Elements of Computing Systems</a> by Nisan and Schocken.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="required-convocations">Required Convocations</h2>

<p>There are no required convocations for this course.</p>

<h2 id="course-prerequisites">Course Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Completion of <em>Data Structures</em> or permission of instructor.</p>

<h2 id="attendance-policy">Attendance Policy</h2>

<p>Attendance and participation will be assessed regularly by your partner. Our work will be conducted extensively in teams; your collaboration will be governed by mutually agreeable contract, and you will be assessed by each-other in accordance with those contracts.</p>

<p>For every unexcused absence beyond two, you will be fined a half-letter grade for each class missed.</p>

<h2 id="technology-policies">Technology Policies</h2>

<p>Much of the work in this course will require use of the computer, so these policies are designed to help you better understand how to be effective in a technology-rich environment. </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Laptop and Software</strong>: We will regularly make use of laptops during class, and you are expected to have them unless explicitly stated otherwise.</li>
  <li><strong>Unapproved Technology</strong>: Technology often disrupts, rather than enhances, our day-to-day lives. <strong>We will be responsible, as individuals, to manage technology like the adults that we are</strong>. We will support each-other in making good decisions about this in class by reminding each-other politely, if necessary, that SMS, Facebook, and similar tools rarely have a place in our classroom.</li>
  <li><strong>Communication</strong>: The course website is your primary source for information about BA4ABW; our Moodle site will be used for posting grades and assignment submission. Messages about the course will often be sent by email. These are all mechanisms you would likely use in a professional position in the real world (corporate websites, internal content management systems, and email)—you are, likewise, expected to use them in a responsible and professional manner in this course.</li>
  <li><strong>Backups</strong>: All students are expected to back-up their work on a daily basis, which includes laboratories, assignments, and quizzes. The best way to do this is to store a copy of all work in a cloud service such as Dropbox, SkyDrive, Google Drive, or to use a DVD, flash drive, or some other media. Storing multiple copies of something on your laptop is not a backup. I will not be sympathetic to lost work in any way, shape, or form.</li>
  <li><strong>Exceptions</strong>: Exceptions to any of these technology policies will be considered on an individual case-by-case basis but will only be granted under extreme circumstances. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="collaboration-and-teamwork">Collaboration and Teamwork</h2>

<p>Team participation is a proven and useful means by which students can learn material. Further, it is usually the first thing employers ask for of students in computing and electronics: <em>we need people who can work on teams</em>. Better Apps for a Better World was designed for you to work with a classmate throughout the term.</p>

<ul>
  <li>All in-class work in Better Apps for a Better World is collaborative unless otherwise specified. When you work with one or more teammates on a project, it is critical that you always clearly identify:
    <ol>
      <li>The names of all contributors.</li>
      <li>The work that each individual contributed.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Please be careful to conform to these standards for teamwork, since they are designed to encourage good learning practices. (Furthermore, copying another person’s work or otherwise failing to adhere to these standards may even result in a charge of academic dishonesty.) <strong>I will make use of the institutional policies laid down regarding academic dishonesty.</strong> In the real world, plagiarism and claiming others’ work as your own could result in you losing your job. Our goal is to support you in your learning, and copying the work of others (or inappropriately reusing work found on the WWW) never constitutes good learning. <strong>CITING YOUR WORK is always, always essential.</strong></p>

<h2 id="grade-distribution">Grade Distribution</h2>

<table>
<tr> <td> Work </td> <td> 60% </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> Exams </td> <td> 12% each </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> Final Project </td> <td> 16% </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>“Work” means work done in-class, homeworks, laboratories, presentations, etc.
as assessed by the instructor, TAs, or (if appropriate) your peers. Put simply,
“more than half of your grade comes from doing excellent work throughout the
course.”</p>

<h2 id="grading-scale">Grading Scale</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.berea.edu/cataloghandbook/academics/aps/grades/gradingscale.asp">Berea College grading scale</a> makes clear that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An <strong>A</strong> represents <strong>excellent</strong> work,</li>
  <li>A <strong>B</strong> represents <strong>good</strong> work, and</li>
  <li>A <strong>C</strong> represents <strong>competent</strong> work.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Excellent</strong> work means that it is free of typographic errors, is well organized, submitted on time, and shows clear attention to detail and a desire to produce the best work possible. It is likely that you will need to complete work in advance of the deadline and discuss it with me before you submit it, revising your assignment based on feedback. It is likely that you will never be able to do work the night before it is due and produce something of excellent quality.</p>

<p><strong>Good</strong> work may have minor grammatical errors, but still shows commitment to producing the best work possible. It is organized, is not late, but it is possible you did not seek help and revision before you submitted your work. If you’re exceptional, you might (once in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxjaQV0ob2E">blue moon</a>), pull off good work at the last minute. But, don’t count on it.</p>

<p>Most work that any of us do is <strong>competent</strong>. Care and effort is needed even to get to this stage, but it is likely that you still have errors, could revise more, and did not give the work as much time as it needed to get to this point. Competent work is something you should be proud of, but I always ask that you strive to do better.</p>

<ul>
  <li>An <strong>A</strong> is in the range of 91% to 100%</li>
  <li>A <strong>B</strong> is in the range of 81% to 90%</li>
  <li>A <strong>C</strong> is in the range of 71% to 80%</li>
  <li>A <strong>D</strong> is in the range of 61% to 70%</li>
  <li>An <strong>F</strong> is a grade of 60% or lower.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <strong>plus</strong> may be earned through exceptional attendance, teamwork, professionalism and collegiality, and participation. A <strong>plus</strong> is completely at the discretion of the instructor.</p>

<p><strong>Any questions regarding grades should never be directed at TAs, but instead always directed to the instructor of the course.</strong></p>

<h2 id="class-atmosphere">Class Atmosphere</h2>

<p>I want many things for students in my classes, and I very much want you to help me achieve these goals. </p>

<ul>
  <li>I want our laboratory to be a relaxed environment where you are <strong>comfortable trying new things</strong> and (sometimes) failing. By “failure” I do not mean “receiving an F,” but I do mean that you try things, make mistakes, and learn from them. The last bit—learning from our mistakes—is the critical part. Neither I, nor you, nor your classmates should put down or belittle a classmate for trying.</li>
  <li>I want you to <strong>look forward to BA4ABW because it is fun</strong>. We should be comfortable with each other—humor and laughter makes the day go faster and better. That said…</li>
  <li>We should <strong>work hard, and be proud of that effort</strong>. For me, a “fun” day is one where I’ve worked hard and improved myself. I have done my best to design a course that will be fun because it challenges us to work hard and do new and interesting things.</li>
  <li><strong>Respect matters</strong>. Respect for each-other, regardless of where we are from and where we are on our life journey is of utmost importance. I have a great deal of respect for your effort as a student; I show that respect by challenging you to extend your limits, and supporting you to the best of my ability as you take risks and engage with the course throughout the semester. </li>
</ul>

<p>In years past, I used Chickering and Gamson’s <a href="/teaching/ba4abw-sp13/media/seven-principles.pdf">Seven Principles of Good Undergraduate Education</a> <img src="/teaching/ba4abw-sp13/images/mini-pdf.png" /> as my guide; in many ways, they still apply. However, as Bereans, we are all committed to the eight <a href="/teaching/ba4abw-sp13/media/berea-college-great-commitments.pdf">Great Commitments</a> <img src="/teaching/ba4abw-sp13/images/mini-pdf.png" />; I ask that we aspire to those as we challenge and learn with each other in this course.</p>

<h2 id="catalogue-description">Catalogue Description</h2>

<p>A study of the design of modern computer systems with a focus on the interaction between hardware design and system software: instruction sets, cache and virtual memory in the context of the memory hierarchy, combinatorial and sequential logic design, high-level processor architecture, memory and processor organization, and parallel computing.	 </p>

<h2 id="evening-lab--support">Evening Lab / Support</h2>

<p>The Computing and Digital Crafts Lab is open Sunday through Thursday from 7:30 to 9:00 PM (except on evenings of convocations). The primary teaching assistant and several other TAs will be able to answer questions about the content in the course during consultations in their  Lab hours. You are strongly encouraged to make use of the help available in the Computing and Digital Crafts Lab, as well as in the instructors’ office hours. Best results are obtained trying to solve problems before asking for help, and you should be prepared to show what you have already tried. Topics in this course build throughout the course, so you should be sure to do your best to keep up with the class, so as to not fall behind. No question to which you do not know the answer is “dumb” unless it goes unanswered because it remained unasked. </p>

<h2 id="statement-regarding-disability">Statement Regarding Disability</h2>

<p>Students who have a disability that may prevent them from fully demonstrating their abilities should contact Cindy Reed, MSW, LCSW, the Disability Services Coordinator at (859) 985-3212, or by email at <a href="mailto:cynthia-reed@berea.edu">cynthia-reed@berea.edu</a>, to discuss accommodations necessary to ensure full participation in this course.
