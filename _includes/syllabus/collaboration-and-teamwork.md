## Regarding Plagiarism

Plagiarism is the use of anyone else's work or ideas without adequate citation. It is a crime which is both easy to commit and easy to avoid. Ideas taken from other people include those from published or unpublished books, articles, websites, TAs, or friends' homework. The best way to avoid plagiarism is to cite ALL your sources, including those from which you paraphrase or borrow ideas, and to be sure use quotation marks when quoting verbatim. If you are not sure whether or not to cite a source, you should cite it! Simply put, plagiarism is stealing because it constitutes theft of someone else's ideas. It is a serious offense, and Berea College takes it very seriously. Plagiarism will not be tolerated! At the first offense, the student will receive an F for that assignment. At the second offense, the student will fail the course. In addition, ALL offenses of plagiarism will be reported to the Associate Provost for Academic Services as detailed in the Berea College Student Handbook.

## Teamwork and Contracts

Learning to work in teams effectively is strongly encouraged. All labs will be specifically designed for teamwork. Most homework assignments will be designed for individual work. Teamwork is designed to be co-authorship so must clearly include all of the authors' names on all submissions. All assignments and labs should be handed in with the author(s) acknowledging all of the help received for each problem. This includes significant help received from the instructors or in the Computing and Digital Crafts Lab Consultants. Note that the instructors or a Computing and Digital Crafts Lab Consultant may help with homework or labs, and while this help should not be acknowledged as co-authorship, it should still be mentioned. This is meant to be a sharing process; do not "give credit" to other students who have not attempted to contribute to the work or to the team's work, because it is ultimately not a help for the student who did not contribute to the work. Thoughtful practice, not (even mindful) copying, is ultimately the best way to learn. Note that on all team-completed homework, students must describe the roles played by each author on the co-authored homework submission.
