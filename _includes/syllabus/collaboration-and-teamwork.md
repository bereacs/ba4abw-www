## Collaboration and Teamwork

Team participation is a proven and useful means by which students can learn material. Further, it is usually the first thing employers ask for of students in computing and electronics: *we need people who can work on teams*. {{ site.title }} was designed for you to work with a classmate throughout the term.

* All in-class work in {{ site.title }} is collaborative unless otherwise specified. When you work with one or more teammates on a project, it is critical that you always clearly identify:
  1. The names of all contributors.
  1. The work that each individual contributed.

Please be careful to conform to these standards for teamwork, since they are designed to encourage good learning practices. (Furthermore, copying another person's work or otherwise failing to adhere to these standards may even result in a charge of academic dishonesty.) **Professors are REQUIRED to make use of the institutional policies laid down regarding academic dishonesty.** In the real world, plagiarism and claiming others' work as your own could result in you losing your job. Our goal is to support you in your learning, and copying the work of others (or inappropriately reusing work found on the WWW) never constitutes good learning. **CITING YOUR WORK is always, always essential.**
