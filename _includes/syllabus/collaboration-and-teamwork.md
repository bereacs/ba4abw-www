## Regarding Plagiarism

Plagiarism is the use of anyone else's work or ideas without adequate citation. It is a crime which is both easy to commit and easy to avoid. Ideas taken from other people include those from published or unpublished books, articles, websites, TAs, or friends' homework. The best way to avoid plagiarism is to cite ALL your sources, including those from which you paraphrase or borrow ideas, and to be sure use quotation marks when quoting verbatim. If you are not sure whether or not to cite a source, you should cite it! Simply put, plagiarism is stealing because it constitutes theft of someone else's ideas. It is a serious offense, and Berea College takes it very seriously. Plagiarism will not be tolerated! At the first offense, the student will receive an F for that assignment. At the second offense, the student will fail the course. In addition, ALL offenses of plagiarism will be reported to the Associate Provost for Academic Services as detailed in the Berea College Student Handbook.

## Teamwork, Contracts, and Peer Evaluations

Learning to work effectively in teams is one of the learning goals of this course.  Teams are most effective when the following five criteria are met: positive interdependence, individual accountability, face-to-face interaction, appropriate use of collaborative skills, and regular self-assessment of team functioning.  For this reason, self and team assessments will be a regular part of the course. Your self-reflection will reinforce and help you to further develop your teamwork skills.

Learning to work in teams effectively is one of the learning goals of this course. All projects will be specifically designed for teamwork. Most homework assignments will be designed for individual work. Teamwork is designed to be co-authorship so must clearly include all of the authors' names on all submissions. All assignments and projects should be handed in with the author(s) acknowledging all of the help received for each problem. This includes significant help received from the instructors or in the Computing and Digital Crafts Lab Consultants. Note that the instructors or a Computing and Digital Crafts Lab Consultant may help with homework or labs, and while this help should not be acknowledged as co-authorship, it should still be mentioned. This is meant to be a sharing process; do not "give credit" to other students who have not attempted to contribute to the work or to the team's work, because it is ultimately not a help for the student who did not contribute to the work. Thoughtful practice, not (even mindful) copying, is ultimately the best way to learn. Note that on all team-completed homework, students must describe the roles played by each author on the co-authored assignment submission.

### Teamwork Bonuses

This is a good bit.

Team-based projects are graded. Everyone on the team gets the same grade.

If all of your team projects are evaluated at 80% or higher, then every member of the team will receive a 5% bonus on the next examination.

What does this mean? We hope it means that everyone on the team will pull together to do their best work, to meet together to proofread writing, and to make sure that materials are submitted on time and named correctly. 

**Put simply, in {{site.short}}, you are rewarded for helping others.**

### Getting Fired

*We do not actually anticipate anyone being fired from {{site.short}}. But we believe the mechanism is important.*

If your team finds you have violated contract so grossly that they would rather not work with you, they can petition to have you fired from the team. When you are fired from a team, you immediately become responsible for submitting all of the work for the current project on your own.

The first time this happens, we will meet with the team to discuss the rationale for the firing, and then we will meet with you. In the first instance, you will recieve a written warning, and the team is no longer elible for a 5% bonus in the current examination cycle.

If you are fired from a team, you immediately become responsible for all of the work on the current project. The professor(s) will counsel with you again.

If you are fired from a team a second time, we will discuss whether you feel you are able to do the work of the course, and whether it would be best for you and your classmates if you considered dropping the course.


### Peer Evaluations

At the end of every team project, you will need to complete a short peer evaluation for everyone on your team. 

The first time you complete your peer evaluations late, we will give you a warning.

The second time you complete your peer evaluations late, you will be ineligible for any bonuses in that examination round.

The third time you complete your peer evaluations late, you will only receive 50% of the points assigned to that project.

*Please do not submit peer evaluations late. Process leads: stay on top of your teammates!*
