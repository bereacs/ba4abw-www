## Technology Policies 

Much of the work in this course will require use of the computer, so these policies are designed to help you better understand how to be effective in a technology-rich environment. 

* **Laptop and Software**: We will regularly make use of laptops during class, and you are expected to have them unless explicitly stated otherwise.

* **Unapproved Technology**: Technology often disrupts, rather than enhances, our day-to-day lives. **We will be responsible, as individuals, to manage technology like the adults that we are**. We will support each-other in making good decisions about this in class by reminding each-other politely, if necessary, that SMS, Facebook, and similar tools rarely have a place in our classroom.

* **Communication**: The course website is your primary source for information about {{site.short}}; our Moodle site will be used for posting grades and assignment submission. Messages about the course will often be sent by email. These are all mechanisms you would likely use in a professional position in the real world (corporate websites, internal content management systems, and email)---you are, likewise, expected to use them in a responsible and professional manner in this course.

* **Backups**: All students are expected to back-up their work on a daily basis, which includes laboratories, assignments, and quizzes. The best way to do this is to store a copy of all work in a cloud service such as Dropbox, SkyDrive, Google Drive, or to use a DVD, flash drive, or some other media. Storing multiple copies of something on your laptop is not a backup. You have no reason to expect sympathy for lost work, given the tools available to you today.

* **Exceptions**: Exceptions to any of these technology policies will be considered on an individual case-by-case basis but will only be granted under extreme circumstances.
