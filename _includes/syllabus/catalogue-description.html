Apps for mobile phones are written by people JUST LIKE YOU. Even if you claim to be "bad with computers," by the end of this course you will have written many amazing apps for mobile phones and tablets. During the semester, we will collaborate in developing mobile apps which explore social networks, games, and mapping. We will share our best apps via the Google Play store, where millions can download and enjoy what we've built. Absolutely no prior experience is required for this course, and we will provide tablets and phones for students to use throughout the semester.  *This course may be used to satisfy the Practical Reasoning Perspective.*
