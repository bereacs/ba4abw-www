Class mini-lectures, discussions, and hands-on laboratory work are considered to be a vital key to success in this course. It is the hope of the instructors that class sessions are both informative and useful, therefore attendance is expected at each class session unless a specific exception is made. If you are sick with flu-like symptoms, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that you stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone except to get medical care or for other necessities. Therefore, please do not come to class if you show flu-like symptoms.  Instead, e-mail the instructors from your room and go to health services immediately.  When you return to class, bring paperwork showing that you sought medical attention that day and your absence will be excused. Students who come late, leave early, or fail to fully participate during the class will be considered absent for that portion of the period, and such partial absences will accumulate. The final grade may be lowered by one third of a letter grade for each unexcused absence beyond the third. Thus, it is the responsibility of the student to contact the instructors about each absence from class. This should be done via email, as soon as possible, and if at all possible before the absence occurs. Students who miss class are held responsible for all of the material covered, assigned, and collected during their absence. Quizzes will be announced and/or occasionally "popped," and because we will drop the lowest quiz grades before computing your overall quiz score, so under nearly all circumstances, make-up quizzes will not be given.
