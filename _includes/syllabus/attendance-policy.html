Attendance and participation will be assessed regularly by your partner. Our work will be conducted extensively in teams; your collaboration will be governed by mutually agreeable contract, and you will be assessed by each-other in accordance with those contracts.

For every unexcused absence beyond two, you will be fined a half-letter grade for each class missed.
