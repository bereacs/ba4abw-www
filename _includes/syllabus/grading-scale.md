## Grading Scale

The [Berea College grading scale](http://www.berea.edu/cataloghandbook/academics/aps/grades/gradingscale.asp) makes clear that:

* An **A** represents **excellent** work,
* A **B** represents **good** work, and
* A **C** represents **competent** work.

**Excellent** work means that it is free of typographic errors, is well organized, submitted on time, and shows clear attention to detail and a desire to produce the best work possible. It is likely that you will need to complete work in advance of the deadline and discuss it with me before you submit it, revising your assignment based on feedback. It is likely that you will never be able to do work the night before it is due and produce something of excellent quality.

**Good** work may have minor grammatical errors, but still shows commitment to producing the best work possible. It is organized, is not late, but it is possible you did not seek help and revision before you submitted your work. If you're exceptional, you might (once in a [blue moon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxjaQV0ob2E)), pull off good work at the last minute. But, don't count on it.

Most work that any of us do is **competent**. Care and effort is needed even to get to this stage, but it is likely that you still have errors, could revise more, and did not give the work as much time as it needed to get to this point. Competent work is something you should be proud of, but you should always strive to do better.

* An **A** is in the range of 91% to 100%
* A **B** is in the range of 81% to 90%
* A **C** is in the range of 71% to 80%
* A **D** is in the range of 61% to 70%
* An **F** is a grade of 60% or lower.

A **plus** may be earned through exceptional attendance, teamwork, professionalism and collegiality, and participation. A **plus** is completely at the discretion of the instructor.

**Any questions regarding grades should never be directed at TAs, but instead always directed to the instructor of the course.**
