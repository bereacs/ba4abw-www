Your work should be completed together or individually as indicated and uploaded to Moodle. Follow the naming convention given above. 

You may submit Word documents (.docx, .doc) or Open Office documents (.odt). If you wrote your assignment using Google Docs, a PDF ({{site.pdf}}) is just fine, too.
