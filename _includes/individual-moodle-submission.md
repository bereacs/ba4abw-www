Your work should be completed individually and uploaded to Moodle. Follow the naming convention given above, and remember to substitute the appropriate bits of the puzzle. Where we say *username*, you should put your username. Where we say *team_name*, you should put your team's name.

For example, if we say the assignment should be called **username-purple-green.docx**, then Matt would name it **jadudm-purple-green.docx**. 

You may submit Word documents (.docx, .doc) or Open Office documents (.odt).
