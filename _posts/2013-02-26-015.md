First, we'll wander around and look at everyone else's app. Then, where there is interest, we'd like to see what took place "behind the scenes," so that people can show off the code they wrote.

Then, we'll switch roles.

Finally, we'll spend some time brainstorming on the following idea:

You are supposed to be introducing Berea College to a prospective student and their family. Sadly, you discover that you're double booked: you're also supposed to be piloting a nuclear jet into outer space, where you will divert an asteroid from destroying the earth (and, thereby, Berea College). 

Normally, you'd handle both things yourself, but it's a Tuesday, and you could never get the hang of Tuesdays. But, fortunately, your team developed a self-guided tour of Berea College. It has some of the mundane stuff (buildings, trees, etc.), but also some of the things that make the college important to you. 

Generate as many things as you can think of, and add them to [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H_eaew8qhuokatttv1bshsMmOwBVQ3o7XFPowlEuC0U/edit?usp=sharing). Although this feels like your first app, we actually have an audience in mind that is closely related to prospective students, so in a number of ways, it is actually a bit different.
