## Due Today

| {{site.reading}} | [Structure, Debugging, and More]({{site.todo}}/ja10/) |

## Team Time

| {{site.group}} | Question Generation | 10m |

For the first ten minutes of class, identify questions you have from the reading. You should have a list of questions "read to go" as a team at the end of the ten minute period.

## In Class

In the table below, *X* is a variable. We do not know its value at this time.

| {{site.stethoscope}} | Q & A | *X*m | 
| {{site.prof}} | [Coins and Dice (or, Help Matt Choose Randomly)]({{site.todo}}/jtp2/)| (*100 - X*)m |

We will start with Q & A from the readings, and then proceed to launch a mini-project. The purpose of this project is to reinforce concepts from the reading. It will have a slightly reduced writeup, and should be completed in pairs or individually, not as a large "team project."
