## Due Today


| {{site.reading}} | [Ladybug and Chapter 17]({{site.todo}}/ladybug-ch17/) |

## Team Time

| {{site.group}} | Team Ladybug Help | 15m |
| {{site.group}} | Presentation Polish | 15m |

First, discuss where you are with the Ladybug coding; help each-other with questions that you have, and if your team is uncertain, ask an instructor or TA to help you develop some insight.

Then, we'll encourage you to spend some time practicing/polishing presentations regarding your last set of apps.

## In Class

| {{site.group}} | Presentations | ~50m |
| {{site.group}} | Go Over Exams | ~30m |

We'll then give presentations; if you keep them short, we can go through all of them.

Then, we'll answer questions regarding the exams.
