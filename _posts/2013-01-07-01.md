### For Next Class


* {{site.cart}} EGet the book [Rocket Science Made Easy](http://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Surgery-Made-Easy-Yourself/dp/0321657292).

* {{site.download}} Install [Bluestack](http://bluestack.com/). Play some Angry Birds. Explore. This is an environment that lets you pretend you have an Android tablet... but it's on your laptop!

* {{site.cloud}} It is highly recommend that you install [Dropbox](http://db.tt/zgUQOl6A). It is free, and using it is required for this course. Watch [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52xllJksWg4) for an explanation of what it is and why you need it.

* {{site.reading}} [Exploring the Syllabus]({{site.base}}/todo/a1/) is our assignment due before the next class. You'll want to allow approximately 1 hour to do this reading. Perhaps start your Bluestack download, and then do the reading while you wait.
