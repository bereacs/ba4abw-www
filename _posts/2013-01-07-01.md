| | Activity | Due | 
| {{site.reading}} | [A1: Exploring the Syllabus]({{site.base}}/todo/a1/) is our assignment due before the next class. You'll want to allow approximately 1 hour to do this reading. Perhaps start your Bluestack download, and then do the reading while you wait. | Jan 10 |
| {{site.stethoscope}} | Complete the [student information survey](#FIXME); this will help us get to know you. | Jan 10 | 
| {{site.cart}} | Get the book [Rocket Science Made Easy](http://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Surgery-Made-Easy-Yourself/dp/0321657292). The bookstore will have it. | Jan 15 |
| {{site.download}} | Install [Bluestack](http://bluestack.com/). Play some Angry Birds. Explore. This is an environment that lets you pretend you have an Android tablet... but it's on your laptop! | Jan 10|
| {{site.download}} | It is highly recommend that you install [Dropbox](http://db.tt/zgUQOl6A). It is free, and using it is required for this course. Watch [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52xllJksWg4) for an explanation of what it is and why you need it. | Jan 15 |
