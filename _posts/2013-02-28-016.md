## Due Today

| {{site.reading}} | [Chapter 19 (Introducing Lists)]({{site.todo}}/lists/) |

## Team Time / In Class

| {{site.prof}} | Q & A | *X* min |
| {{site.group}} | Chapter 6 | 60m - *X* |
| {{site.group}} | Campus Tour (9AM) | 50m |

We'll begin with questions regarding the reading.

From there, we'll spend the remainder of the first hour working on chapter 6. It is very short; we suspect you'll get done in class. If not, finish afterwards. It is intended as an opportunity to see how lists work hands-on and ask questions.

Then, we'll head over to the Visitor's Center, and take a campus tour. You are taking the tour both to get things fresh into your mind as to how a tour works, as well as have a chance to "step outside yourself" and reflect on what intangible parts of a tour matter.

Class will end with the end of the tour; you may want to bring your things with you to the Visitor's Center. That, or we can lock things in the classroom before we leave.
