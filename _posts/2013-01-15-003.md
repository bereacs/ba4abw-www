### Due Today

| {{site.reading}} | [A2: Rocket Surgery Ch 1-4]({{site.base}}/todo/a2/) |
| {{site.download}} | Install [App Inventor]({{site.base}}/infra/setup-app-inventor/). |

### Team Time

Everyone should have a working App Inventor setup. In your pairs, check that everything is working, and demonstrate it to each-other.

Check that you can start App Inventor and launch an emulator. We'll be walking through the use of App Inventor in class.

### In Class

| {{site.laptop}} | [Get to know App Inventor]({{site.base}}/todo/l0/) | ~50m |
| {{site.group}} | The <strike>Candy Cane</strike> *New* Oompa Loompas | ~30m | 

<small>It is likely that we will spend the majority of class time working with App Inventor, but we will have some additional discussion re: the Oompa-Loompas if time permits.</small>
