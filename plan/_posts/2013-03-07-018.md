## Due Today

From now on, please see the main page for what is due on any given day. We will not repeat it on individual pages for fear that we will make mistakes.

## Team Time / In Class

| {{site.md}} | Q&A about Lists | *X*m |
| {{site.compy}} | [Timers Exploration]({{site.todo}}/exploring-timers) | 1h - *X* |
| {{site.group}} | [Testing Prototypes]({{site.todo}}/testing-prototypes) | 1h |

We will start by taking questions about lists if there are any lingering.

Then, we'll spend roughly an hour working on a short exploration of timers. This follows on from previous work to help explore ideas you have seen previously.

Finally, we'll further develop and test the prototypes we developed in the past week.
