## Due Today

| {{site.reading}} | [Finish Ladybug]({{site.todo}}/ma13/) |
| {{site.reading}} | Refresh Krug's Testing Protocol |

## Team Time

During Team Time (~30m), as a group, run Krug's [testing protocol on a pair of websites]({{site.todo}}/ml1/). We will then break to discuss how that went, what you found. This lays a foundation for later testing.

## In Class

During the remainder of class, we will have a visit from Leslie Ortquist-Ahrens, who is Berea's Scholar of Teaching and Learning in the CeTL. She'll be doing a midterm evaluation with you, which we hope you will enjoy and take advantage of.
