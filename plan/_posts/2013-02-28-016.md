## Due Today

From now on, please see the main page for what is due on any given day. We will not repeat it on individual pages for fear that we will make mistakes.

## Team Time / In Class

| {{site.prof}} | Q & A | *X* min |
| {{site.group}} | Chapter 6 | 60m - *X* |
| {{site.group}} | Campus Tour (9AM) | 50m |

We'll begin with questions regarding the reading.

From there, we'll spend the remainder of the first hour working on chapter 6. It is very short; we suspect you'll get done in class. If not, finish afterwards. It is intended as an opportunity to see how lists work hands-on and ask questions.

Then, we'll head over to the Visitor's Center, and take a campus tour. You are taking the tour both to get things fresh into your mind as to how a tour works, as well as have a chance to "step outside yourself" and reflect on what intangible parts of a tour matter.

Class will end with the end of the tour; you may want to bring your things with you to the Visitor's Center. That, or we can lock things in the classroom before we leave.
